title: Leetcode 1302. Deepest Leaves Sum
tags: [dfs, tree]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/deepest-leaves-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/deepest-leaves-sum/

#### Solution
Let us do it in easy way:

1. First use `dfs1` to find the deepest level of binary tree, in fact this is problem **104** Maximum Depth of Binary Tree. Nothing very special here: just check depths of children and choose maximum one. So, it is postorder dfs here.
2. Next, use `dfs2` to collect all nodes which are the deepest. It can be sovled easily if we give parametr `d` as second to our function: each time when we see node with desired depth, we add it to `self.ans`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```
class Solution:
    def deepestLeavesSum(self, root):
        def dfs1(node):
            if not node: return 0
            return max(dfs1(node.left), dfs1(node.right)) + 1
        
        def dfs2(node, d):
            if not node: return
            if d == depth: self.ans += node.val
            dfs2(node.left, d+1)
            dfs2(node.right, d+1)
        
        self.ans = 0
        depth = dfs1(root)
        dfs2(root, 1)
        return self.ans
```
