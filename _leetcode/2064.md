title: Leetcode 2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store
tags: [binary search]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store/

#### Solution
The idea of this problem is to use binary search, where we ask question: given `mid` restriction for each shop, how many shops we need to distribute all goods? For example if we have `Q = [6, 11]` and `mid = 6`, then we need 3 shops: `[6], [6, 5]`. If we have `mid = 3`, we need `6` shops: `[3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 2]`. What we need to find is the smallest `mid`, such that we have `<= n` shops needed.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n * log W)`, where `W = sum(Q)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimizedMaximum(self, n, Q):
        beg, end = 0, max(Q)
        
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if sum(ceil(i/mid) for i in Q) <= n:
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid
        
        return end
```
