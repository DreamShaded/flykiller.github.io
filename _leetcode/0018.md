#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/

#### Solution
In this problem we are asked to find not one 4-sum with sum equal to `target`, but all of them. If we were asked to find only one sum, there is `O(n^2)` solution: create array of pairs and then try to find the new pair is equal to `target` minus sums of two numbers. However we need to return all sums and imagine the case `nums = [1, 2, 3, ..., n]`. Then there will be `C_n^4 = O(n^4)` different ways to choose `4` number out of `n` and all sums are in range `[4, 4n]`. It means, that by pingenhole principle there will be some sum which we meet `Omega(n^3)` times, that is `>= alpha*n^3` for some constant alpha.

So, in general case we can have only `O(n^3)` solution (though with small constant, like 1/6) which allows us to pass problem constraints. The idea is exaclty the same as in other **2Sum** problems: sort numbers, choose `i` and `j` and then use two pointers approach to get solutions.

#### Complexity
We need to choose `i` and `j` with complexity `O(n^2)` and then for each choosen pair use two-pointers approach so we have `O(n^3)` total complexity. Space complexity is `O(n)` to keep sorted data.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def fourSum(self, nums, target):
        nums.sort()
        n, ans = len(nums), []
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                goal = target - nums[i] - nums[j]
                beg, end = j + 1, n - 1

                while beg < end:
                    if nums[beg] + nums[end] < goal:
                        beg += 1
                    elif nums[beg] + nums[end] > goal:
                        end -= 1
                    else:
                        ans.append((nums[i], nums[j], nums[beg], nums[end]))
                        beg += 1
                        end -= 1

        return set(ans)
```
