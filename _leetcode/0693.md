#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-number-with-alternating-bits/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-number-with-alternating-bits/

#### Solution
There is starighforward `O(32)` solution, where we just check bits, either in string, or in number directly. There is also `O(1)` complexity solution, where we use structure of number: if we have `1010101` and we shift it two bits `10101` and evaluate xor, we get `1000000`, and all we need to check now is it is power of two, for this we have `x&(x-1)` trick.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def hasAlternatingBits(self, n):
        n ^= n >> 2
        return not (n & (n - 1))
```
