#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/

#### Solution
For `follow` and `unfollow` we just keep defaultdicts with lists or sets, so we can easily iterate over all persons given user follow. For `postTweet` we need to keep list of all tweets this person made with timestamps. These 3 operations can be done in `O(1)`.

The main difficulty with `getNewsFeed(userID)`, we need to go over all `K` persons which follow `userID` and choose `10` of them with biggest timestamps. It can be done in `O(10K)` complexity, how can we do it? We kinda need `K` iterators, choose the smallest of them and repeat the procedure. We can just merge all these lists, create heap in `O(10K)` and then return `10` biggest elements in `O(log K)`. However, complexity is still `O(10K)`. (If we do not use heaps it will be `O(100K)`). Open question, can we do better?

#### Complexity
It is `O(1)` for first `3` functions and `O(10K)` for the last one, where `K` is numbers of person in feed.

#### Code
```python
class Twitter:
    def init(self):
        self.foll = defaultdict(set)
        self.tweets = defaultdict(list)
        self.time = 0
        
    def postTweet(self, userId, tweetId):
        self.tweets[userId].append((self.time, tweetId))
        self.time -= 1
        
    def getNewsFeed(self, userId):
        feed = self.foll[userId] | set([userId])
        tweets = list(chain(*[self.tweets[idx] for idx in feed]))
        heapify(tweets)
        ans = []
        for i in range(min(10, len(tweets))):
            ans.append(heappop(tweets)[1])
        return ans
        
    def follow(self, followerId, followeeId):
        self.foll[followerId].add(followeeId)
        
    def unfollow(self, followerId, followeeId):
        self.foll[followerId].discard(followeeId)
```
