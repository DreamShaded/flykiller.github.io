#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/24/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/24/

#### Solution
Almost the same as Leetcode 0679 24 Game, but here division is integet and we can not change order of nums.

#### Complexity
See complexity analysis of leetcode problem.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        def helper(nums):
            if len(nums) == 1: return nums
            result = []
            for i in range(1, len(nums)):
                left  = helper(nums[:i])
                right = helper(nums[i:])
                for x, y in product(left, right):
                    if y != 0: result += [x+y, x-y, x*y, x//y]
                    else: result += [x, 0]
            return result
            
        return 24 in helper(nums)
```
