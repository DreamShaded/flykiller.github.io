#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Equalize-List/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Equalize-List/

#### Solution
We need to minimize `|a1 - x| * c1 + ... + |an - x| * cn` by `x`. We can look at it as `|a1 - x| + ... + |a1 - x| + ...` Solution of this problem is median of numbers `a1...a1 (c1 times), ..., an...an (cn times)`. We can find median, sorting values and then on each step check if we reached median or not.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, costs):
        if len(nums) <= 1: return 0
        m = (sum(costs) + 1) // 2
        pairs = sorted([a, c] for a, c in zip(nums, costs))
        for i, (a, c) in enumerate(pairs):
            n = min(c, m)
            m -= n
            if m == 0: break

        return sum(abs(a - pairs[i][0]) * c for a, c in pairs)
```
