#### Solution
Just use counters to check that we can create word.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n + m)` where `n` is total length of words in `words` and `m` is a length of `chars`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countCharacters(self, words, chars):
	cnt = Counter(chars)
        return sum(len(w) for w in words if not Counter(w) - cnt)
```
