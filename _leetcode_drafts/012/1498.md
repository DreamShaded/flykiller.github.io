#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subsequences-that-satisfy-the-given-sum-condition/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subsequences-that-satisfy-the-given-sum-condition/

#### Solution
Let us sort numbers. Use two pointers, where the smallest one correspondes to the left poiner and the biggest one to the right pointer. Then for each `beg` find the biggest `end` where we have `A[beg] + A[end] <= target`. For all such subsequences we have `2**(end - beg)` options.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numSubseq(self, A, target):
        A, n = sorted(A), len(A)
        beg, end, ans, M, P = 0, len(A) - 1, 0, 10**9 + 7, [1]
        for i in range(n): P += [(P[-1] * 2) % M]
        while beg <= end:
            if A[beg] + A[end] > target:
                end -= 1
            else:
                ans += P[end - beg]
                beg += 1
        return ans % M
        
```
