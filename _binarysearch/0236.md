#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Spiky-Plants/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Spiky-Plants/

#### Solution
We can notice, that in the end position will be for every plant we have heights `H[i], H[i] + 1` or `H[i] + 2`, no more. So, we can now just run dp with states `dp[i, H]` the minimum cost we pay when we reached `i`-th plant and heigth `H`. Alternative way is to use layer by layer `dp`, where we keep only values for layer `i`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n*9)` for time and `O(3)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, H, C):
        dp = {0: 0}
        n = len(H)
        for i in range(n):
            dp2 = defaultdict(lambda: float("inf"))
            for h1 in dp:
                for h2 in H[i], H[i] + 1, H[i] + 2:
                    if h1 != h2:
                        dp2[h2] = min(dp2[h2], dp[h1] + (h2 - H[i]) * C[i])
            dp = dp2
        return min(dp.values())
```
