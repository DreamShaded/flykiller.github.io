title: Leetcode 0817 Linked List Components
tags: [linked list]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-components/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-components/

#### Solution
Let us create set of nodes `G` and then what we need to find in fact number of nodes, such that this node is in set and next node not in set. We also need to create `dummy` variable before head.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is length of linked list, space complexity is `O(m) < O(n)`, where `m` is number of element in `G`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numComponents(self, head, G):
        set_G, ans, dummy = set(G), 0, ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        while dummy.next:
            if dummy.val not in set_G and dummy.next.val in set_G:
                ans += 1
            dummy = dummy.next
        return ans
```
