#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/

#### Solution
In this problem we need to traverse tree and find all nodes which have all ancestors less or equal than given node. Let us traverse our tree and change its nodes, such that in each `node` we will keep the biggest value on path `node -> .. -> root`.

1. We update `self.count` if `child.val >= root.val`, that is node `child` is good.
2. We update value for `child`, in this case when we run recursion for this node, we know the biggest value on the path between this node and root.
3. Finally, we run recursion for every children.

#### Complexity
It is just `O(n)` for time and `O(h)` for additional space, because we use recursion.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    def goodNodes(self, root):
        for child in filter(None, [root.left, root.right]):
            self.count += child.val >= root.val
            child.val = max(child.val, root.val)
            self.goodNodes(child)
  
        return self.count + 1
```
