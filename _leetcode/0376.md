title: Leetcode 0376. Wiggle Subsequence
tags: []

Define by `dp(i, 1)` the biggest length of wiggle subsequense, which ends with element `nums[i]` and has and increasing status, and `dp(i, -1)` is the biggest length of wiggle subsequence, which ends with element `nums[i]` and has decreasing status.

How we can calculate `dp(i, 1)`, looking at previous element `nums[i-1]`:
1. if `nums[i-1] < nums[i]`, then it means that we need to look at `dp(i - 1, -1) + 1`: look at the biggest subsequence ending in `i-1`, which have decreasing status and add `1`, because we can continue it by one element.
2. if `nums[i-1] >= nums[i]`, then we can not continue subsequence with decreasing status, all we can do is to look at `dp(i-1, 1)`.
3. Very similar logic is used to calculate `dp(i, -1)`. Here I write both cases in very compact way in one line. 

Note also that here we can say we use greedy approach: it is always enough to take previous element `nums[i-1]` to continue to build our subsequence, the logic is the following: actually what matters are **local extremums** in our array. Imagine, that we have part of array like this `100, 1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 20, 1`. What can we say about part `1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 20`? We can take only `2` elements, and the best case will be to take `1` and `20`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(n)` as well, which potentially can be reduced to `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, s):
            if i == 0: return 1
            return dp(i-1, -s) + 1 if (nums[i] - nums[i-1])*s < 0 else dp(i-1, s)
            
        return max(dp(len(nums)-1, -1), dp(len(nums)-1, 1))
```
