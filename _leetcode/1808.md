title: Leetcode 1808. Maximize Number of Nice Divisors
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1808/

In fact, this problem is very similar to problem **343. Integer Break** https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/, let me explain why:

Imagine, that we have number `m = p1^a1*p2^a2*...*pk^ak`, this is standard representation of number, where `p1, ..., pk` are some prime numbers and `a1, ..., ak` some integer powers. Then total number of  **nice** divisors can be calculated by `a1*...*ak`: just using combinatorics rules: first one can be choosen by `a1` options, second by `a2` and so on. Also, we are given, that `a1 + ... + ak <= n`, where by `n` here I defined `primeFactors` for simplicity. So, the problem now looks like:

Given `a1 + ... + ak <= n` find maximum `a1 * ... ak`.

Let us prove, that it is always better when we make numbers equal to `2` or `3`. Indeed, if we have bigger, we can split it to two parts: like `4 -> 2*2`, `5 -> 2*3`, `6 -> 3*3` and so on. Moreover, if we have `2, 2, 2`, it is always better to replace it to `3, 3`. So in the end: optimal configuration has only `2` and `3` and number of `2` is not more than two. Let us just check all `3` cases: `n` gives reminders `0, 1, 2` when divided by `3` and evaluate answer.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(log n)`, because function `pow` with given modulo `M` will use expontiation trick with doubling of exponent. Space complexity is `O(1)`.


```python
class Solution:
    def maxNiceDivisors(self, n):
        M = 10**9 + 7
        if n <= 3: return n
        if n % 3 == 0: return pow(3, n//3, M)
        if n % 3 == 1: return (pow(3, (n-4)//3, M) * 4) % M
        return (2*pow(3, n//3, M)) % M
```
