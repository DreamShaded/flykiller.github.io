#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/

#### Solution
Another classical DP problem, similar to problem **0010**. Let us define by `dp(i, j)` answer to the question if `s[:i+1]` and `p[:j+1]` can be matched. Then we can have different cases:

1. if `i == -1 and j == -1` it means, that we reached both empty strings, we return `True`.
2. if `i == -1`, it means, that `s` string is empty (and `t` is not empty), in this case we are happy only if all symbols of `p` are equal to `*`, so we check last symbol check `dp(i, j-1)`.
3. if `j == -1`, but `i` is not equal to `-1`, we already checked it previously, we return `False`.
4. if `s[i] == p[j]`, that is last symbols are equal, we remove them and go to `dp(i-1, j-1)`
5. if `p[j]` not equal to `?` or `*` (that is it is letter) and it is not equal to `s[i]`, we can not match, so we return `False`.
6. if `p[j]` is equal to `?`, we can match in only one way and we again go to `dp(i-1, j-1)`.
7. finally, if we have `*` as `p[j]`, we can have two options: we either say that this `*` is finished already, so we delete it, or not finished yet, then we delete symbol from `s`.

#### Complexity
Complexity: time and space complexity is `O(mn)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s, p):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == -1 and j == -1: return True
            if i == -1: return dp(i, j-1) and p[j] == "*"
            if j == -1: return False

            if s[i] == p[j]: return dp(i-1, j-1)
            if s[i] != p[j] and p[j] not in "?*": return False
            if p[j] == "?": return dp(i-1, j-1)
            if p[j] == "*": return dp(i-1, j) or dp(i, j-1)
            
        return dp(len(s) - 1, len(p) - 1)
```
