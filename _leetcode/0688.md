tags: [dp, 2d-array]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-probability-in-chessboard/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-probability-in-chessboard/

#### Solution
Let us use `dp[k][i][j]` be probability to be on `(i, j)` cell on `k` moment of time. Then we can update all table in `O(8N^2K)`: for each cell look at all its knight neighbors.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(8n^2K)`, space complexity is `O(n^2K)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def knightProbability(self, N, K, r, c):
        dp = [[[0] * N for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(K+1)]
        dp[0][r][c] = 1
        neibs = [[1,2],[1,-2],[-1,2],[-1,-2],[2,1],[2,-1],[-2,1],[-2,-1]]
        for k,i,j in product(range(K),range(N),range(N)):
            for dx, dy in neibs:
                if 0 <= i+dx < N and 0 <= j+dy < N:
                    dp[k+1][i][j] += dp[k][i+dx][j+dy] / 8
        
        return sum(chain(*dp[-1]))
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(N^6 * log K)` time complexity solution, if we use `N^2 x N^2` transition matrix (which is very sparse in fact) and look at our problem as Markov Chain.
