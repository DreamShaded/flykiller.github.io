#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/2-keys-keyboard/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/2-keys-keyboard/

#### Solution
Note, that all we can do is to multiply number of symbol by some integer number. So, what actually we need to do is to find factorization with the smallest sum of factors. It can be easily shown that we need factorization upto prime numbers.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of prime factorization is `O(sqrt{n})`, space complexity is `O(log n)` due to recursion.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, n):
        if n == 1: return 0
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return i + self.minSteps(n//i)
        return n
```
