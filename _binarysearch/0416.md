#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Cell-Fusion/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Cell-Fusion/

#### Solution
Just simulate process, using heap.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, cells):
        h = [-x for x in cells]
        heapify(h)
        while h:
            if len(h) == 1: return -h[0]
            x = heappop(h)
            y = heappop(h)
            if x != y:
                heappush(h, -((-x + -y)//3))

        return -1
```
