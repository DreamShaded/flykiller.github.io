tags: [2d-array, math]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/surface-area-of-3d-shapes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/surface-area-of-3d-shapes/

#### Solution
Calculate first surface of all side walls, then for each two adjacent elements in grid subtract walls which they have in common and finally, add floors and ceilings.

#### Complexity
Time complexity will be `O(n^2)`, space is `O(n)`, which can be reduced to `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def surfaceArea(self, grid):
        ans = sum(sum(row) for row in grid) * 4
        for row in chain(grid, zip(*grid)):
            ans -= 2*sum(min(x, y) for x,y in zip(row, row[1:]))
        return ans + 2*sum(v != 0 for r in grid for v in r)
```
