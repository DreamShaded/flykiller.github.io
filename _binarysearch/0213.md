#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Phone-Number-Combinations/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Phone-Number-Combinations/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0017. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number.

#### Complexity
Both time and space is `O(3^m*4^n*(m+n))`, where m is number of digits for which we have `3` options and n is number of letters for which we have `4` options, because we have `3^m*4^n` options with `m+n` length each.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, digits):
        if not digits: return []
        d = {"2":"abc", "3":"def", "4":"ghi", "5":"jkl", "6":"mno", "7":"pqrs", "8":"tuv", "9":"wxyz"}
        return ["".join(num) for num in product(*[d[i] for i in digits])] 
```
