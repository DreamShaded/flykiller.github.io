title: Leetcode 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1342/
---

The straightforward solution for this problem is to just simulate the process: if we see even number we divide it by 2 and if we see odd number, we subtract 1.

**Complexity**: time complexity of this solution is `O(20) = O(1)`, because length of number will always be no more than `20`. Space complexity is also `O(1)`

```
class Solution:
    def numberOfSteps (self, num):
        steps = 0
        while num:
            num = num&1 if num & 1 else num>>1
            steps += 1
            
        return steps
```

### Oneliner

We can also notice, that each step we make with even number decrease its binary length by `1` and each step with odd number removes one `1` from binary representation. So final answer will be binary length of number + number of ones we have and minus `1`, because in the end we have number `0` with length `1`.

**Complexity**: time and space complexity is still `O(1)`, however here we have some potential to improve: there are more efficient ways to count binary length of number and to count number of ones in binary representation.

See for example problem **191. Number of 1 Bits** for more efficient ways to find number of `1` bits.

```
return len(bin(num)) + bin(num).count("1") - 3
```
