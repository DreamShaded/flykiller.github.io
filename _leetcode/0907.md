#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/

#### Solution
The idea is for each number with index `i` find how many times we meet it in total as minimum of subarray. For this we need to find:
1. `lft` is the closest number to the left of `i`, such that it is smaller than `arr[i]`.
2. `rgh` is the closest number to the right of `i`, such that it is smaller or equal than `arr[i]`.

Why we consider `smaller` for one side and `smaller or equal` for another? Because we can have equal numbers. Imagine we have `...1...1....1...1..1...`, then we for each `1` we want to find subarrays where it is minimum and it is the **leftest** one.

3. Finally, we evaluate `(rgh[i] - i)*(i - lft[i])*arr[i]` for each index, because we can go `(rgh[i] - i)` steps to the right and `(i - lft[i])` to the left.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sumSubarrayMins(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        rgh, lft = [n]*n, [-1]*n

        stack1 = []
        for i in range(n):
            while stack1 and arr[i] < arr[stack1[-1]]: 
                idx = stack1.pop()
                rgh[idx] = i
            stack1.append(i)
            
        stack2 = []
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            while stack2 and arr[i] <= arr[stack2[-1]]:
                idx = stack2.pop()
                lft[idx] = i
            stack2.append(i)
            
        return sum((rgh[i] - i)*(i - lft[i])*arr[i] for i in range(n)) % (10**9 + 7)
