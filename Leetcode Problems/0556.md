title: Leetcode 0556. Next Greater Element III
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0556/

Let us start from example and see how our algorithm should work.
Imaigne `n = 234157641`. Our goal is to find next number with the same digits, which is greater than given one and which is the smallest one. It makes sense to try to take our number as close to original one as possible. Let us try to do it: can it start from `2......`, yes, for example `24...`. Can it start with `2341...`? Yes, it can be `23417...`. Can it start with `23415...`? No, it can not, and the reason, that the rest what we have `7641` already biggest number given digits `7, 6, 4, 1`. 
So, we can see now, how our algorithm should work:
1. Start from the end and look for increasing pattern, it our case `7641`.
2. If it happen, that all number has increasing pattern, there is no bigger number with the same digits, so we can return `-1`.
3. Now, we need to find the first digit in our ending, which is less or equal to `digits[i-1]`: we have ending `5 7641` and we are looking for the next number with the same digits. What can go instead of `5`: it is `6`! Let us change these two digits, so we have `6 7541` now. Finally, we need to reverse last ditits to get `6 1457` as our ending.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(m)`, where `m` is number of digits in our number, space complexity `O(m)` as well.

**PS** see also problem **31. Next Permutation**, which uses exactly the same idea.

```
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, n):
        digits = list(str(n))
        i = len(digits) - 1
        while i-1 >= 0 and digits[i] <= digits[i-1]:
            i -= 1
            
        if i == 0: return -1
        
        j = i
        while j+1 < len(digits) and digits[j+1] > digits[i-1]:
            j += 1
        
        digits[i-1], digits[j] = digits[j], digits[i-1]
        digits[i:] = digits[i:][::-1]
        ret = int(''.join(digits))
        
        return ret if ret < 1<<31 else -1
