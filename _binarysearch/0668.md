title: BinarySearch 0668 Longest Concatenated String
tags: [dp, string]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Concatenated-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Concatenated-String/

#### Solution
Let `dp[i, j]` be the answer when we traversed several words and it is the longest length which starts with `i` and ends with `j`. Then when we get new word `[beg, end]`, we can try to attach it to all words with `[i, beg] + [beg, end]` to update `[i, end]`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n*k^2)` for time and `O(k^2)` for space, where `k = 26` is the size of alphabet

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, words):
        alph = string.ascii_lowercase

        n = len(words)
        dp = Counter()

        for word in words:
            beg, end = word[0], word[-1]
            for i in alph:
                if dp[i, beg]:
                    dp[i, end] = max(dp[i, end], dp[i, beg] + len(word))

            dp[beg, end] = max(dp[beg, end], len(word))

        return max(dp[c, c] for c in alph)
```
