The idea here is to use both binary search and dfs: each time we compare `nums[mid]` and `nums[end]` and we can have several options:
1. `nums[mid] > nums[end]`, for example data can look like `3,4,5,6,7,1,2`. Then we need to check conditions:
a. If `nums[end] < target <= nums[mid]`, then it means, that we need to look in the left half of our data: see region `1` on the left image.
b. Else means, that we need to look in the right half of data.
2. `nums[mid] < nums[end]`, for example data can look like `6,7,1,2,3,4,5`. Then we need to check conditions:
a. `if nums[mid] < target <= nums[end]`,  then it means, that we need to look in the right half of our data: see region `1` on the right image.
b. Else means, that we need to look in the left half of data.
3. In this problem it can happen, that `nums[mid] == nums[end]`, and in this case we do not know where to find our number, so we just look for it in both halves.

**Complexity**: if we do not have any duplicates, it is for sure `O(log n)`. If we have any, it can be potentially `O(n)` for cases like `111111111111121111`: where we do not know the place of `2` and we basically need to traverse all elements to find it.

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums, target):
        def dfs(beg, end):
            if end - beg <= 1: return target in nums[beg: end+1]
            
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if nums[mid] > nums[end]:   # eg. 3,4,5,6,7,1,2
                if nums[end] < target <= nums[mid]:
                    return dfs(beg, mid)
                else:
                    return dfs(mid + 1, end)
            elif nums[mid] < nums[end]: # eg. 6,7,1,2,3,4,5
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[end]:
                    return dfs(mid + 1, end)
                else:
                    return dfs(beg, mid)
            else:
                return dfs(mid+1, end) or dfs(beg, mid)
    
        return dfs(0, len(nums)-1)
```
