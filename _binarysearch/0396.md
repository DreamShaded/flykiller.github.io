#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Remove-Last-Duplicate-Entries/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Remove-Last-Duplicate-Entries/

#### Solution
For each element keep places where we have it. Also keep boolean array of taken, which have `1` in the beginning. Then iterate through values and if we have more than one, update last element of `taken`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        d = defaultdict(list)
        taken = [1] * n
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            d[x] += [i]

        for val in d:
            if len(d[val]) > 1:
                taken[d[val][-1]] = 0

        return [nums[i] for i in range(n) if taken[i]]
```
