#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/

#### Solution
We can use usual dfs or bfs traversal, but it will have `O(V * max(m, n))` time complexity, where `V` is number of empty cells and `m, n` are dimensions of our maze.

We can use dp to precalculate all possible moves of ball given each place: the position where it will stop when it goes down, up, left or right. Then, when we do dfs or bfs traversal we can do steps in `O(1)` time. 

#### Complexity
Overall time complexity is `O(mn)`, space is also `O(mn)` to keep dp table and to keep visited noted.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def hasPath(self, maze, start, D):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(x, y, dx, dy):
            if not 0 <= x+dx < m or not 0 <= y+dy < n: return (x, y)
            if maze[x+dx][y+dy] == 1: return (x, y)
            return dp(x+dx, y+dy, dx, dy)

        def dfs(x, y):
            visited.add((x, y))
            for dx, dy in dirs:
                x2, y2 = dp(x, y, dx, dy)
                if (x2, y2) in visited: continue
                dfs(x2, y2)

        visited = set()
        m, n = len(maze), len(maze[0])
        dirs = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]
        dfs(start[0], start[1])
        return (D[0], D[1]) in visited
```
