title: Leetcode 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1015/

First of all, let us notice, that if number is divisible by `2` or by `5`, then we need to return `-1` immediatly, because number ending with `1` can not divide by `2` or `5`. From now on we assume, that `K` is not divisible by `2` or `5`. Let us consider numbers:

`1`
`11`
`111`
...
`111...111`,

where were have `K` ones in the last group. Then, there can be only two cases:
1. All reminders of given numbers when we divide by `K` are different.
2. Some two reminders are equal.

In the first case, we have `K` numbers and also `K` possible reminders and they are all different, it means, that one of them will be equal to `0`.

In the second case, two numbers have the same reminder, let us say number `11...1111` with `a` ones and `111...11111` with `b` ones, where `b > a`. Then, difference of these two numbers will be divisible by `K`. What is the difference? It is number `11...1100...000` with `b-a` ones and `a` zeroes at the end. We already mentioned that `K` is not divisible by `2` or `5` and it follows, that `11...111` divisible by `K` now, where we have `b-a` ones.

So, we proved the following statements: **if K not divisible by 2 and 5, then N <= K**. What we need to do now is just iterate through numbers and stop when we find number divisible by `K`. To simplify our cumputation, we notice, that each next number is previous multiplied by `10` plus `1`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution(object):
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, K):
        if K % 2 == 0 or K % 5 == 0: return -1
        rem, steps = 1, 1
        while rem % K != 0:
            rem = (rem*10 + 1) % K
            steps += 1
        return steps
```
