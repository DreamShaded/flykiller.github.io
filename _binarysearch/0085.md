tags: [math]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sum-of-the-Digits/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sum-of-the-Digits/

#### Solution
If strings not allowed than divide number by `10` and get last digit until it is possible.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, num):
        ans = 0
        while num:
            num, last = divmod(num, 10)
            ans += last
        return ans
```
