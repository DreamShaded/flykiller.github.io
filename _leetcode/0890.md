title: Leetcode 0890. Find and Replace Pattern
tags: [string, hash table]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-pattern/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-pattern/

#### Solution
Let us just reuse problem **205** Isomorphic Strings  - idea is to keep two dictionaries and check for each pair of symbols if we can create connection, where the question is to do exactly the same but for one pair of words. See also problem **0290** Word Pattern, here I use exaclty the same logic, but instead of words we have letters.
 
 #### Complexity
 If length of each word is `k` and we have `n` of them, then time and space complexity will be `O(nk)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findAndReplacePattern(self, words, pattern) :
        def isIsomorphic(s, t):
            d1, d2 = {}, {}
            for i, j in zip(s, t):
                if i not in d1:
                    if j in d2: return False
                    else:
                        d1[i] = j
                        d2[j] = i
                elif d1[i] != j: return False

            return True
        
        return [w for w in words if isIsomorphic(w, pattern)]
