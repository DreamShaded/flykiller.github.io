tags: [string, dp, palindrome, dp-intervals]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence-ii/

#### Solution
One way to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming with states `dp(l, r, prev)`, where `[l, r]` is interval we are working with and `prev` is previous symbol we take.

1. if `s[l] == s[r] != prev`, it means that we can take `s[l]` and `s[r]` to extend our palindrome.
2. in the opposite case, one of the symbols `s[l]` or `s[r]` will not be taken, so return maximum among these two possibilities.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2 * s)`, where `s` is the size of alphabet.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(l, r, prev):
            if l >= r: return 0
            if s[l] == s[r] != prev: return 2 + dp(l + 1, r - 1, s[l])
            return max(dp(l + 1, r, prev), dp(l, r - 1, prev))
        
        ans = dp(0, len(s) - 1, '')
        dp.cache_clear()
        return ans
```

#### Remark
To avoid TLE for lru_cache we can use `dp.cache_clear()`.
There is also `O(n^2)` time complexity solution without factor `s`.
