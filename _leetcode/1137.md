#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/

#### Solution 1
If you solved problem about Fibonacci numbers, this one will be a piece of cake for you. The idea is to use dynamic programming, where `dp[i]` is answer for `i-th` number. Then we can find `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3]`. Moreover, we do not need to use additional memory, because in fact we need to keep only last `3` numbers: `a, b, c`. Then we need to do `n` updates `a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c`. Note also, that I start with numbers `a, b, c = dp[-2], dp[-1], dp[0]`, where `dp[-1] = 0`, because `dp[-1] + dp[0] + dp[1] = dp[2]` and `dp[-2] = 1`, because `dp[-2] + dp[-1] + dp[0] = dp[1]`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n):
        a, b, c = 1, 0, 0
        for _ in range(n):
            a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c
            
        return c
```

#### Solution 2
If you plunge deep into solution of Fibonacci numbers problem, then you are aware that there is faster than `O(n)` solution for big `n`. The idea is so called fact matrix power. For every reccurunt equation we have, we can write it as evaluation of specific element of matrix of recurrence. In this problem `M = [[1,1,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]]`, which is equivalent to `a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c`. Notice, that we can also do matrix power with given module `MOD`, which I keep in my code, but we do not need in in fact - I keep it here for more reusable code. Notice that we need to be careful with `np` implementation, do not use it if `M = 10**9 + 7` and `M > 8`, see my remark here https://flykiller.github.io/patterns/linear%20algebra

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log n * M^3)`, where `M = 3` is the size of matrix. For given constraits there will be no gain in speed, but for bigger `n` there will be. Space complexity is `O(M^3)`.

#### Code
```python
import numpy as np

class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n):
        def power(M, n, MOD):
            result = np.eye(len(M), dtype = np.int64)
            while n > 0:
                if n%2: result = np.dot(M, result) % MOD
                M = np.dot(M, M) % MOD
                n //= 2
            return result
        
        t = power(np.array([[1,1,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]]), n, 1<<32)
        return t[0][-1]
```
