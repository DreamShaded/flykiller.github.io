### Solution 1

What we need to do in this problem is to follow definition. Let us generate row `r` and do `k` iterations until we reached desired `k`-tho row. How we generate next row, using current? We need:
1. Add `1` to the beginning of new row.
2. Evaluate sums of elements with indexes differ by `1`.
3. Add `1` to the end of new row.

This can be written as `[1]+[r[j]+r[j+1] for j in range(len(r)-1)]+[1]`.

What we need to do now is to repeat this `k` times and this is all, we can use `reduce` function to do it.

**Complexity**: space complexity as it asked is only `O(k)`, each moment of time we have only one(two) rows. Time complexity is `O(k^2)` because for each row we do `k` iterations. Theoretically time complexity can be reduced to `O(k)` if we use direct formulas for elements of pascal triangle, but `k` is very small and there will no be difference in this problem.

```python
class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex):
        return reduce(lambda r,_:[1]+[r[j]+r[j+1] for j in range(len(r)-1)]+[1], range(rowIndex),[1])
```

### Solution 2

Let us note, that `1001^5 = 1 005 010 010 005 001`, so if we want to find row of Pascal triangle for small numbers `k`, then we can just use power of number `1000...001` and then split it into parts. For thes problem it is enough to take `10000000001` and then split by blocks with size `10`. 

**Complexity**: Space complexity is also `O(k)`, but more like `O(10k)`, because we have string of length `10k` in the end. Time complexity is more difficult to compute, I think it is `O(k)` also.

```python
class Solution:
    def getRow(self, k):
        return [1] + [int(str((10**10+1)**k)[-10*(i+1):-10*i]) for i in range(1,k+1)]
```
