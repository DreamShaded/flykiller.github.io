#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sequence-reconstruction/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sequence-reconstruction/

#### Solution
Original solution is supposed to be Topological sort: for example we topologically sort our nodes, and then find the longest path and check if it has length `n-1`, where $n$ is number of nodes, complexity is `O(E + V)`. 

However for this problem we do not need topological sort at all: first we check if set of all nodes in `seqs` is the same as `org` and if not, return `False`. Then we put all pairs of adjacent elements from `seqs` to defaultdict `G`. Finally, we iterate over `org` and check for each pair of adjacent elements it is inside our defaultdict. Also we need to check that we do not have edges in opposite direction, that is if `index[x] >= index[y]`, we return False immedietly

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(E + V)`, space complexity is `O(E + V)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sequenceReconstruction(self, org, seqs):
        if set(org) != set(chain(*seqs)): return False
        index = {num: i for i, num in enumerate(org)}
        
        G = defaultdict(set)
        for seq in seqs:
            for x, y in zip(seq, seq[1:]):
                G[x].add(y)
                if index[x] >= index[y]: return False

        return all(y in G[x] for x, y in zip(org, org[1:])) 
```
