#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/

#### Solution
Actually, it can be shown, that `k`-th symbol in our string will depend on parity of number of ones in binary representation of number `k`. Also we need to take into account that we start with index `1`, not `0`, so finally solution can be written as the following oneliner.

#### Complexity
 Time and space complexity is `O(log k)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def kthGrammar(self, N, K):
        return int(bin(K-1).count("1") % 2 == 1)
```
