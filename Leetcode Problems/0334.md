title: Leetcode 0334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0334/
---

This problem is special case of problem **300 Longest Increasing Subsequence**, but here we are asked if this length is more or equal to `3`. Let us use the same logic here: we keep two-elements array `a`, where:
1. `a[0]` is the smallest end among all increasing subsequences of length `1`.
2. `a[1]` is smallest end among all increasing subsequences of length `2`. Note, that `a[1] >= a[0]` always.

We iterate over `nums` and check conditions: if `elem < a[0]`, we can create `1` elements increasing subsecuense with smaller end. If  `a[0] < elem < a[1]`, we can update increasing subsequence of size `2`. In other case we found subsequnce of length `3` and we can return `True`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`: we iterate over our data once. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums):
        a = [float("inf")]*2
        for elem in nums:
            if elem < a[0] : a[0] = elem
            if elem < a[1] and elem > a[0]: a[1] = elem
            if elem > a[1] : return True
        return False
