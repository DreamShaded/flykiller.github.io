#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/

#### Solution
In my opinion it is very difficult problem if you are not familiar with graph theory. What is actually asked here is to find all so-called **bridges** in given graph, here you can see detailed explanation of the very classical algorithm: https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/bridge-searching.html

Here I give some details about the code, using the link I provided. The key observation about the bridge is:

Let us be at `node` when we use dfs. Then if we have edge `(node, child)`, such that from `child` or any of its descendants we do not have **back edge** (edge which leads to already visited node) to `node` or to some of its ancestors, it means that `(node, child)` is bridge. Indeed, this condition means that there is only one path from `node` to `child`.

1. We use `dfs` with some extra steps to solve this problem. Each time we run `dfs(node, par)`, where `node` is current node we are in and `par` is parent of this node. In the beginning `par` is equal to `-1` means, that we do not have any parent.
2. We keep global `self.timer` variable: is time of visit of one or another node.
3. We keep `tin[node]` array, the time when we visit `node`.
4. Also we keep `fup[node]` array, which will be defined as follow: it is minimum among `tin[node]`: time of visit of `node` and all times of visit for so-called **back edges** and `fup[child]` for all children of `node`. By our definition, `fup[node]` is the smallest time among all descendants of `node`.

Then it can be shown that `(node, child)` is bridge if and only if `fup[child] > tin[node]`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is just `O(E + V)` to traverse all graph with dfs and some extra-steps. Space complexity is `O(E + V)` as well to create `graph` and keep `used, tin, fup` arrays.

#### Code
```
class Solution:
    def criticalConnections(self, n, connections):
        used, tin, fup = [0]*n, [-1]*n, [-1]*n
        self.timer, ans = 0, []
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        def dfs(node, par = -1):
            used[node] = 1
            tin[node] = fup[node] = self.timer + 1
            self.timer += 1
            for child in graph[node]:
                if child == par: continue
                if used[child] == 1:
                    fup[node] = min(fup[node], tin[child])
                else:
                    dfs(child, node)
                    fup[node] = min(fup[node], fup[child])
                    if fup[child] > tin[node]: ans.append([node, child])
        
        for i, j in connections:
            graph[i].append(j)
            graph[j].append(i)
            
        for i in range(n):
            if not used[i]: dfs(i)
                
        return ans
