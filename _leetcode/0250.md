#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-univalue-subtrees/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-univalue-subtrees/

#### Solution
Traverse tree with `dfs(node)` function, which will return pair of elements: first one is `True` if subtree is univalue and second one is value of this subtree. We also use `None` value for nodes outside tree. How we can check now if subtree is univalue? We check answer for left and for right. If both of them are `True` ans also if left and right value both in `[None, node.val]`, then we are happy: we add `1` to final answer.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is number of nodes, space complexity is $O(h)$, where $h$ is heigth of the tree.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countUnivalSubtrees(self, root):
        self.ans = 0
        
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return (True, None)
            L, R = dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right)
            cands = [None, node.val]
            
            found = L[0] and R[0] and R[1] in cands and L[1] in cands
            if found: self.ans += 1
            return (found, node.val)
        
        dfs(root)
        return self.ans
```
