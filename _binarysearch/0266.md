#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Buying-Cars/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Buying-Cars/

#### Solution
Just sort cars and choose the smalles ones.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(1)` for additional space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, P, k):
        P = sorted(P)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(P)):
            if P[i] <= k:
                ans += 1
                k -= P[i]
            else:
                return ans
        return ans
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(n)` time complexity solutoin, using binary search + quick algorithm for `k`-th order statistics - either `O(n)` worst time median of medians or `O(n)` average quickselect.
