Let us iterate over our string `S` and check lengths of string we have after each step. Let us consider example `S = hi2bob3`.

1.`h`, length = 1
2.`hi`, length = 2
3.`hi2`, string becomes `hihi` and length equal to `4`.
4.`hi2b`, string becomes `hihib`, length equal to `5`.
5.`hi2bo`, string becomes `hihibo`, length equal to `6`.
6.`hi2bob`, string becomes `hihibob`, length equal to `7`.
7.`hi2bob3`, string becomes `hihibobhihibobhihibob`, length equal to `21`.

Let us write down all these lengths into array `len`: if we have letter, we increase previous element by `1`, if it is digit, we increase previous element multiplied by this digit.

Now, we need to find letter, imagine we have `K = 18`. We will traverse our `S` from the end and check `K % lens[i]`. 
1. `18 < 21`, so on this step we do nothing.
2. `18 % 7` = 4, it means, that string `hihibob` repeated `3` times and we need to choose element number `4` from this string.
3. `4 < 6, 4 < 5`, so we skip these two steps
4. Now we have `K = 4` and `lens[i] = 4`, and we make `K = 0`. We are good, we can stop? Not exactly, the problem, that now we on the place `hi2` and we are on digit symbol, so we need to continue.
5. Now, `K = 0` and `lens[i] = 2`, and also we have string `hi` so far, so we can stop and answer will be `i`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity as well. Space complexity can be reduced to `O(1)`, if we do not store `lens` and only the last one and go back on the fly.

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeAtIndex(self, S, K):
        lens, n = [0], len(S)
        for c in S:
            if c.isdigit():
                lens.append(lens[-1]*int(c))
            else:
                lens.append(lens[-1] + 1)
                
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            K %= lens[i]
            if K == 0 and S[i-1].isalpha():
                return S[i-1]
```
