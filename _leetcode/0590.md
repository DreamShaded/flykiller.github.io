tags: [dfs, tree, recursion, stack]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/

#### Solution
Very similar to Problem **0589**, but here we need to traverse `cur.children` and then reverse `out` in the end.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def postorder(self, root):
        if not root: return []
        stack, out = [root], []
        while stack:
            cur = stack.pop()
            out.append(cur.val)
            for child in cur.children:
                stack += [child]
        return out[::-1]
```
