#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/tournament-winners/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/tournament-winners/

#### Solution
All we need to do is to keep score for each person, so we can quickly update it.

#### Complexity
Time complexity for `init, reset, addScore` is `O(1)`, time complexity for `top` is `O(n log k)`

#### Code
```python
class Leaderboard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scores = Counter()  #id -> score
        
    def addScore(self, playerId, score):
        self.scores[playerId] += score

    def top(self, K):
        return sum(i[1] for i in self.scores.most_common(K))
        
    def reset(self, playerId):
        self.scores[playerId] = 0
```

#### Remark
I think time complexity for `top` can be improved, one way to do it is to use that scores are not so big and use bucket sort.
