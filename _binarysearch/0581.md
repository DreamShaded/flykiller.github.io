#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Word-Concatenation/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Word-Concatenation/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0472. Concatenated Words.

#### Complexity
Time is `O(n*m^3)`, where `n = len(words)`, `m = max(len(w))`. Space is `O(mn)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, words):
        d = set(words)
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(word):
            for i in range(1, len(word)):
                if word[:i] in d and (word[i:] in d or dfs(word[i:])):
                    return True
            return False
        
        return len([word for word in words if dfs(word)])
```
