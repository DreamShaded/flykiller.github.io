tags: [string, groupby]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Alliteration/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Alliteration/

#### Solution
Create array of the first letters, then use groupby.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space, where `n` is the total length of all words.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, words):
        x = [w[0] for w in words]
        ans = 0
        for x, y in groupby(x):
            ans = max(ans, len(list(y)))
        return ans
```
