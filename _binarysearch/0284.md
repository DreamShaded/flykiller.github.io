#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Palindromic-Tree/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Palindromic-Tree/

#### Solution
`O(n)` space complexity solution is easy. If we want to have `O(h)` space complexity, let us use inorder traversal and reversed inorder traversal in the way of generators and then compare element by element.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(h)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, root):
        def inorder1(node):
            if not node: return
            yield from inorder1(node.left)
            yield node.val
            yield from inorder1(node.right)

        def inorder2(node):
            if not node: return
            yield from inorder2(node.right)
            yield node.val
            yield from inorder2(node.left)

        return all(a1 == a2 for a1, a2 in zip(inorder1(root), inorder2(root)))
```
