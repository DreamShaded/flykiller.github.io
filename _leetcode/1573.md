#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-split-a-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-split-a-string/

#### Solution
First we need to check if number of ones is divisibly by `3`. If it is not, return `False`. Also, if it is equal to zero, we can use **stars and bars** problem to get direct answer. Finally we find places of all ones and we can put first split after the third part or ones and second after the second third of ones.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(n)` as well. Space can be reduced to `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, s):
        M = 10**9 + 7
        n, k = len(s), s.count("1")
        if k % 3 != 0: return 0
        if k == 0: return (n-1)*(n-2)//2 % M
        P = [i for i in range(n) if s[i] == "1"]
        return (P[k//3] - P[k//3 - 1]) * (P[2*k//3] - P[2*k//3 - 1]) % M
```
