#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Package-Matching/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Package-Matching/

#### Solution
I spend some time, trying to understand problem statement, it is not very well formulated. The idea of solution is the following. Let us sort sales and buyers and then keep `offerc` is sorted list with avaliable offers we have. Each time we have new sell we add all buyers which have some money to this moment - you can look at it as two pointers approach. We will keep amount of moneys for these people and then we use bisect_left in our sorted list to find the person with smallest amount of money who can afford to buy this package - here we use greedy strategy.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n + m log m + m log n)` for time, where `n` is the size of sales and `m` is the size of buyers and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
#### Code by awice
class Solution:
    def solve(self, S, B):
        S, B = sorted(S), sorted(B)

        ans = j = 0
        offers = SortedList()
        for d, p in S:
            while j < len(B) and B[j][0] <= d:
                offers.add(B[j][1])
                j += 1

            index = offers.bisect_left(p)
            if index < len(offers):
                offers.pop(index)
                ans += 1

        return ans
```
