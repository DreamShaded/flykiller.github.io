#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-equal-substrings-with-minimum-difference/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-equal-substrings-with-minimum-difference/

#### Solution
The idea is that we only interested in substrings of length `1`. Indeed, if we have length `2` or more, we can remove last letters and decrease `j-a`.

So, all we need to do is to consider for each symbol first occurence in `s1` and last occurence in `s2` and choose minimum difference.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are sizes of strings and space complexity is `O(s)`, where `s` is size of alphabet.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countQuadruples(self, s1, s2):
        n1, n2 = len(s1), len(s2)
        d1, d2 = Counter(), Counter()
        for i in range(n1 - 1, -1, -1):
            d1[s1[i]] = i
        for j in range(n2): 
            d2[s2[j]] = j
            
        diffs = [d2[el] - d1[el] for el in d1 if el in d2]
        if not diffs: return 0
        return diffs.count(max(diffs))          
```
