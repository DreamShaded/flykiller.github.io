title: Leetcode 1659. Maximize Grid Happiness
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1659/
---

Let us us dynamic programming with the following states: 

1. `index`: number of cell in our grid, going from `0` to `mn-1`: from top left corner, line by line.
2. `row` is the next row filled with elements `0`, `1` (for introvert) or `2` (for extravert): see on my diagramm.
3. `I` is number of interverts we have left.
4. `E` is number of extraverts we have left.

Now, let us fill out table element by element, using `dp` function:

1. First of all, if we reached `index == -1`, we return 0, it is our border case.
2. Compute `R` and `C` coordinates of our cell.
3. Define `neibs`: it is parameters for our recursion: fist element is what we put into this element: `0`, `1` or `2`, second and third elements are new coordinates and last one is gain.
4. Now, we have `3` possible cases we need to cover: new cell is filled with `0`, `1` or `2` and for each of these cases we need to calculate `ans`:
a) this is `dp` for our previous row, shifted by one
b) gain we need to add when we add new intravert / extravert / empty
c) check right neighbor (if we have any) and add `fine`: for example if we have 2 introverts, both of them are not happy, so we need to add `-30-30`, if we have one introvert and one extravert, it is `20-30` and if it is two extraverts it is `20+20`.
d) do the same for down neigbor if we have any (**see illustration for help**)

Finally, we just return `dp(m*n-1, tuple([0]*n), I, E)`

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(m*n*I*E*3^n)`, because: `index` goes from `0` to `mn-1`, `row` has `n` elements, each of them equal to `0`, `1` or `2`.

    def getMaxGridHappiness(self, m, n, I, E):

            if index == -1: return 0

            R, C, ans = index//n, index%n, []
            neibs = [(1, I-1, E, InG), (2, I, E-1, ExG), (0, I, E, 0)]  
            
            for val, dx, dy, gain in neibs:
                tmp = 0
                if dx >= 0 and dy >= 0:
                    tmp = dp(index-1, (val,) + row[:-1], dx, dy) + gain
                    if C < n-1: tmp += fine[val][row[0]]  #right neighbor
                    if R < m-1: tmp += fine[val][row[-1]] #down neighbor
                ans.append(tmp)

            return max(ans)
        
        if m < n: m, n = n, m
            
        return dp(m*n-1, tuple([0]*n), I, E)
