#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/array-nesting/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/array-nesting/

#### Solution
Actually, what we have is permutation of numbers, where we need to find the longest loop. What we need to do is to look at our `nums` as graph, imagine we have `nums = [5, 4, 0, 3, 1, 6, 2]`, then we have connections: `0 -> 5, 1 -> 4, 2 -> 0, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 1, 5 -> 6, 6 -> 2`, which in fact can be looked as several disjoint loops `0 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 0`, `1 -> 4 -> 1`, `3 -> 3`.

So, we start from value `0` and start to traverse our graph. We will keep already visited nodes in `visited` set, so if we already traversed some loop, we never do it again: it is very similar what we do in classical dfs algorithm when we want to find islands.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`, because we never visit node twice.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def arrayNesting(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        visited = [0]*n
        for i in range(n):
            start, depth = i, 1
            while not visited[start]:
                visited[start] = depth
                start = nums[start]
                depth += 1
                
        return max(visited)    
```

#### Remark
Can we do better? Not in time: we need to look at our data at least once, what about space? We can also rewrite original array with `-1` with `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space. Finally, if we are not allowed to modify data, we can use loop detection technique with slow and fast iterators with `O(n)` time and `O(1)` memory.
