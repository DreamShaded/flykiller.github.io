#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Target-Number-with-Operations-Sequel/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Target-Number-with-Operations-Sequel/

#### Solution
The idea is start from the end and go in the opposite direction. Each time we have even number, divide it by `2`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, x, y):
        steps = 0
        while True:
            if y <= x:
                return steps + (x - y)
            if y % 2 == 0:
                y //= 2
            else:
                y += 1
            steps += 1
        return steps
        
```
