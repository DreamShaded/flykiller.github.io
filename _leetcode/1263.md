#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-move-a-box-to-their-target-location/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-move-a-box-to-their-target-location/

#### Solution
The idea is to use bfs where we have states `(S_x, S_y, B_x, B_y)` When we move box, we add element to the end of queue, when we just move person without box, we add to the start of the queue. Actually what we have here we can call it `0-1` bfs approach.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2m^2)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minPushBox(self, grid):
        def check(x, y): return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m and grid[y][x] != "#"
        
        m, n, v = len(grid), len(grid[0]), set()
        neibs = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]
        
        for x, y in product(range(n), range(m)):
            if grid[y][x] == "B": B = (x, y)
            if grid[y][x] == "S": S = (x, y)
        
        Q = deque([(0,) + S + B])
                
        while Q:
            steps, Sx, Sy, Bx, By = Q.popleft()
            if grid[By][Bx] == "T": return steps
            
            for dx, dy in neibs:
                if check(Sx+dx, Sy +dy) and (Sx+dx, Sy+dy) != (Bx, By):
                    new = (Sx+dx, Sy+dy, Bx, By)
                    if new not in v:
                        v.add(new)
                        Q.appendleft((steps,) + new)
            
            if abs(Sx - Bx) + abs(Sy - By) == 1:  #move box
                if check(2*Bx-Sx, 2*By-Sy):
                    new = (Bx, By, 2*Bx - Sx, 2*By - Sy)
                    if new not in v:
                        v.add(new)
                        Q.append((steps + 1,) + new) 
        
        return -1
```

#### Remark
There is also approach using Dijkstra algorithm.
