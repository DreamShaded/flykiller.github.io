#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Shortest-Cycle-Containing-Target-Node/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Shortest-Cycle-Containing-Target-Node/

#### Solution
Here we need to carefully use bfs: traverse graph and mark nodes visited after we we visit all its neighbours.

#### Complexity
It is `O(E + V)` for time and `O(V)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, graph, target):
        queue = deque([(0, target)])
        V = set()
        while queue:
            dep, cur = queue.popleft()
            if cur in V: continue
            for neib in graph[cur]:
                if neib == target: return dep + 1
                queue.append([dep + 1, neib])
            V.add(cur)

        return -1
```
