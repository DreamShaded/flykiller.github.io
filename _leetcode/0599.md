title: Leetcode 0599 Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists
tags: [string, hash table]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists/

#### Solution
Just put both lists to hash table and then traverse them, updating sum of indexes if needed.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O((l1+l2) * x)` and space complexity is the same where `l1` and `l2` are numbers of restaurants in the first and in the second lists and `x` is average length of name of restaurant.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, l1, l2):
        d1 = {w: i for i, w in enumerate(l1)}
        d2 = {w: i for i, w in enumerate(l2)}
        min_sum = min(d1[x] + d2[x] for x in d1 if x in d2)
        return [x for x in d1 if x in d2 and d1[x] + d2[x] == min_sum]
```
