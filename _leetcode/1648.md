title: Leetcode 1648 Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls
tags: [math, greedy, binary search]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sell-diminishing-valued-colored-balls/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sell-diminishing-valued-colored-balls/

#### Solution
The idea is to answer question: given value `mid`: how many balls with value `>= mid` we can take. If we draw numbers of balls with bars, then there will be the place, when we have fully taken rows on the top and then there will be one not fully filled row. We can find the place of the last fully filled row using binary search.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, I, order):
        beg, end = 0, max(I) + 1
        
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if sum(max(i-mid, 0) for i in I) <= order:
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid
                
        ans = sum(max(0, (i + end + 1)*(i - end)) for i in I)//2
        rest = order - sum(max(i - end, 0) for i in I)   
        return (ans + rest * end) % (10**9 + 7)
```
