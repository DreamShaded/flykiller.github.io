#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-Size-of-Two-Non-Overlapping-Intervals/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-Size-of-Two-Non-Overlapping-Intervals/

#### Solution
Sort intervals by its ends. Then for each interval `(x, y)` we need to look at all intervals with end `< x`, for this we use cumulative minimum of suffixes.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, I):
        I = sorted(I)
        acc = list(accumulate([y - x for x, y in I[::-1]], min))[::-1]
        ans = float("inf")
        for x, y in I:
            idx = bisect.bisect(I, [y, float("inf")])  
            if idx < len(I):
                ans = min(ans, y - x + 1 + acc[idx] + 1)

        return ans if ans != float("inf") else 0
```
