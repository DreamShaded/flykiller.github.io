#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Reverse-an-Inner-Linked-List/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Reverse-an-Inner-Linked-List/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0092. Reverse Linked List II.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, head, m, n):
        m, n = m + 1, n + 1
        if m == n: return head
        dummy = LLNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        pre = dummy
        for i in range(m-1):
            pre = pre.next
            
        curr = pre.next
        nxt = curr.next
        
        for i in range(n-m):
            tmp = nxt.next
            nxt.next = curr
            curr = nxt
            nxt = tmp
            
        pre.next.next = nxt
        pre.next = curr
        return dummy.next
```
