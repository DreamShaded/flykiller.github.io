#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Costly-Flight-of-Stairs/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Costly-Flight-of-Stairs/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1696. Jump Game VI, but here we need to do minimums.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        deq, n = deque([0]), len(nums)

        for i in range(1, n):
            while deq and deq[0] < i - k: deq.popleft()
            nums[i] += nums[deq[0]]   
            while deq and nums[i] <= nums[deq[-1]]: deq.pop()
            deq.append(i)
            
        return nums[-1]
```
