#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-value-of-a-mysterious-function-closest-to-target/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-value-of-a-mysterious-function-closest-to-target/

#### Solution
let `dp[i]` be all possible values of function, ending with element with index `i`. In fact there can be only `O(log M)` different values, where `M` is the biggest number: because when we add one more number to the left number of `1` bits can only decrease or number stays the same. So what we need to is to update `dp` and each time look for smallest distance to target. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*log M)`, space is `O(log M)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def closestToTarget(self, arr, target):
        dp, ans = set(), float('inf')
        for a in arr:
            dp = {a & b for b in dp} | {a}
            for c in dp: ans = min(ans, abs(c - target))
        return ans
```

#### Remark
It is very similar to problem **0898**
