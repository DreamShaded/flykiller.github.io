#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-adjacent-swaps-for-k-consecutive-ones/submissions/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-adjacent-swaps-for-k-consecutive-ones/submissions/

#### Solution
The idea is the following: let us look at all places where we have `1`. Then we need to find the window of size `k`, such that sum between elements in this group and its median is the smallest. For one window we can check it in `O(1)

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, A, k):
        A = [i for i, a in enumerate(A) if a]
        ans = float("inf")
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(A))
     
        for i in range(len(A) - k + 1):
            ans = min(ans, acc[i + k] - acc[k//2 + i] - acc[(k + 1)//2 + i] + acc[i])
        return ans - (k//2) * ((k + 1)//2)
```
