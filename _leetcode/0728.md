#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/self-dividing-numbers/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/self-dividing-numbers/

#### Solution
Literally, do what is asked: check every number in given range.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O((R - L) * log R)`, where `L` and `R` are our `left` and `right`. Space complexity is `O(R - L)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def selfDividingNumbers(self, left, right):
        out = []
        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            if all(s != "0" and i % int(s) == 0 for s in str(i)):
                out += [i]
        return out
```
