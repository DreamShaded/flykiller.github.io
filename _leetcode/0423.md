title: Leetcode 0423. Reconstruct Original Digits from English
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0423/

Actually what is asked in this problem is to solve linear system of equations: imagine that we have `f0, ... f9` frequencies of words `zero, ... nine`, then we need to solve `10` equations with `10` variables. We can look at this at slightly different angle:
1. Let us look at word `zero`: we meet symbol `z` only in this word, so total number of times we have `z` in string is number of times we have word `zero` inside. So, what we do: we keep global counter `cnt` and subtract all frequencies, corresponding to letters `z`, `e`, `r`, `o`.
2. Look at word `two`, we have symbol `w` only in this word, remove all words `two`.
3. Look at word `four`, we have symbol `u` only in this word, remove all words `four`.
4. Look at word `six`, we have symbol `x` only in this word, remove all words `six`.
5. Look at word `eight`, we have symbol `g` only in this word, remove all words `eight`.
6. Look at word `one`, we have symbol `o` only in this word if we look at words we still have, remove all words `one`.
7. Look at word `three`, we have symbol `t` only in this word if we look at words we still have, remove all words `three`.
8. Look at word `five`, we have symbol `f` only in this word if we look at words we still have, remove all words `five`.
9. Look at word `seven`, we have symbol `s` only in this word if we look at words we still have, remove all words `seven`.
10. Look at word `nine`, we have symbol `n` only in this word if we look at words we still have, remove all words `nine`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is just `O(n)`, where `n` is length of `s`, because first we create counter and then we iterate over `10` digits and update `cnt` in `O(1)` time. Space complexity is `O(n)` as well to format our answer.

```python
class Solution:
    def originalDigits(self, s):
        cnt = Counter(s)
        Digits = ["zero","two","four","six","eight","one","three","five","seven","nine"]
        Corresp = [0,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9]
        Counters = [Counter(digit) for digit in Digits]
        Found = [0]*10
        for it, C in enumerate(Counters):
            k = min(cnt[x]//C[x] for x in C)
            for i in C.keys(): C[i] *= k
            cnt -= C
            Found[Corresp[it]] = k
            
        return "".join([str(i)*Found[i] for i in range(10)])     
```
