#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-swap/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-swap/

#### Solution
There is `O(n^3)` brute-force solution.

There is also `O(9n)` solution: let us first find last places for each digit in `O(n)`. Then let us start from the first digit and find if we have `9` after it, if we have `8` after it and so on. Then we go to the second digit and continue. Space complexity is `O(n)`. 

There is also just `O(n)` solution (without constant `9`), where we for each place keep `dp[i]` be the largest digit starting from place `i`: we fill this array from the end. The second part of algorithm is the same.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(n)` for space where `n` is number of digits in `num`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumSwap(self, num):
        D = list(str(num))
        dp = list(accumulate(D[::-1], max))[::-1]
        
        for i, digit in enumerate(D):
            if dp[i] > digit:
                for k in range(i, len(D)):
                    if D[k] == dp[i]: j = k     
                D[i], D[j] = D[j], D[i]
                return "".join(D)
        
        return num
```
