title: Leetcode 0471 Encode String with Shortest Length
tags: [dp, string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-string-with-shortest-length/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-string-with-shortest-length/

#### Solution
This is difficult dp problem. Let `dp[i][j]` be a string with minimum length of encoded substring `s[i:j+1]`. For each of `O(n^2)` sub-strings, we first check if it is repetition of some other substring, see problem **0459** Repeated Substring Pattern. We can do it in `O(n)` time. Next step is to try to split string to two parts in `O(n)` ways and evaluate sums for each split.

#### Complexity
Overall time complexity is `O(n^4)`, because we have `O(n^2)` different states and for each state we need to work with `O(n)` pairs of strings with length `O(n)`. Space complexity potentially also `O(n^3)`, because we can keep a lot of encoded strings.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def encode(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[""] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for l in range(n):   #length
            for beg in range(n-l):
                end = beg + l

                dp[beg][end] = s[beg: end + 1]
                if l < 4: continue

                q = dp[beg][end]
                ind = (q + q)[1:-1].find(q) + 1
                if ind != 0:
                    ss = str((l+1) // ind) + "[" + dp[beg][beg+ind-1] + "]"
                    dp[beg][end] = min(dp[beg][end], ss, key = len)
                
                for k in range(beg, end):
                    dp[beg][end] = min(dp[beg][end], dp[beg][k] + dp[k+1][end], key = len)

        return dp[0][-1]
```
