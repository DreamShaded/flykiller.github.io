title: Leetcode 0498. Diagonal Traverse
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0498/
---

Main trick to solve this problem easily is to understand the structure of our diagonal traverse. Let us call level each diagonal we traverse: 
1. In first level we have only one coordinates: `[0, 0]`.
2. In second level we have two points: `[0, 1]` and `[1, 0]`.
3. In third level we have three points: `[0, 2]`, `[1, 1]` and `[2, 0]`.

Now, aogorithm becomes very easy:
1. For each level put all elements in this level to dictionary `levels`: note, that for each level we put it in direct order.
2. Now, for each level choose if we traverse it in direct order or reverse, using `[::lev%2*2-1]` notation. If `lev` is odd number, then we have `[::1]`, that is direct order, if `lev` is even, we have `[::-1]`, that is reverse order.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(mn)`: we traverse each element once. Additional space complexity in this approach is also `O(mn)`, because we keep `levels` dictionary. Theoretically, we can put our data directly into long list and then reverse some parts, we will have `O(1)` additional space in this case.

```python
class Solution:
    def findDiagonalOrder(self, matrix):
        if not matrix: return []
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        levels = defaultdict(list)
        for i, j in product(range(m), range(n)):
            levels[i+j].append(matrix[i][j])
                
        out = []
        for lev in range(m + n):
            out += levels[lev][::lev%2*2-1]   
        return out
```
