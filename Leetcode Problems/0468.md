The main difficulty of this problem if you meet it on real interview, is to not forget any border cases, there are **a lot** of them. First of all let us split problem into two subproblems: possible candidates for **IPv4** and possible candidates for **IPv6**.

1. We have candidate for **IPv4** if we meet symbol **.** in our data. If we met it, we split our data into parts, using **.** and we need to check:
1.1 If we have not **4** parts, we return `"Neither"`.
1.2 We check each part and if it is empty and if it starts with zero, but not zero, we also return  `"Neither"`.
1.3 Finally, we check that every part is number and is less than 256, if it is not true, we return  `"Neither"`.
1.4 If we passed all previous steps, we return `IPv4`.
2. We have candidate for **IPv4** if we meet symbol **:** in our data. If we met it, we split our data into parts, using **:** and we need to check:
2.1 If number of parts not equal to `8`, we return `"Neither"`
2.2 If we have empty parts of parts with length more than `4`, we return `"Neither"`
2.3 We check each symbol in our part and if we found something not in `1234567890abcdefABCDEF`, we return `"Neither"`
2.4 If we passed all previous steps, we return `IPv6`.

**Complexity**: both time and space are `O(n)`, where `n` is number of elements in our string.

```
class Solution:
    def validIPAddress(self, IP):
        if "." in IP:
            splitted = IP.split(".")
            if len(splitted) != 4: return "Neither"
            for part in splitted:
                if len(part) == 0 or (len(part)>1 and part[0] == "0"): return "Neither"
                if not part.isnumeric() or int(part) > 255: return "Neither"                
            return "IPv4"        
        elif ":" in IP:
            symbols = "0123456789abcdefABCDEF"
            splitted = IP.split(":")
            if len(splitted) != 8: return "Neither"
            for part in splitted:
                if len(part) == 0 or len(part) > 4: return "Neither"
                for elem in part:
                    if elem not in symbols: return "Neither"                 
            return "IPv6"      
        return "Neither"
```
