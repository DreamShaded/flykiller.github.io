tags: [dp, string, dp-intervals]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/

#### Solution
Let us do the following steps:

1. Generate all possible palindromes, we can do it in `O(n^2)` time: consider all `2n-1` possible middles and then extend around them until we can. Dictionary `d[i]` will keep all palindromes which start with place `i`.
2. `dp(i)` is number of minimum palindromes for string `s[:i]`. Then to calculate `dp(i)` we need to calculate `dp(k-1) + 1` for all `k <= i and such that `i in d[k]`, this means that `s[k:i+1]` is palindrome; then we need to choose the minimum among all these candidates.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2)` to generate all palindromes and `O(n^2)` to evaluate all `dp` values, so overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`. Space complexity is `O(n^2)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minCut(self, s):
        d, n = defaultdict(set), len(s)
        
        def helper(i, j):
            while i >= 0 and j < n and s[i] == s[j]:
                d[i].add(j)
                i, j = i - 1, j + 1
        
        for k in range(n):
            helper(k, k)
            helper(k, k + 1)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i == -1: return -1
            return min([dp(k-1) + 1 for k in range(0, i+1) if i in d[k]])
        
        return dp(n-1)
```
