#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-prime-fraction/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-prime-fraction/

#### Solution
On of the ways to solve this problem is to use binary search: for given number `D` ask question: how many fraction there is, which are less than this number `D`. It can be solved again, using binary search in `O(n log n)` time, as it is shown in the code above. 

#### Complexity
Final time complexity is `O(n log n log T)`, where `T` is biggest number in our `A`. Space is `O(n)`.

#### Code 1
```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallestPrimeFraction(self, A, K):
        beg, end = 0, 1
        while end - beg > 1e-10:
            mid = (beg + end)/2
            if sum(bisect.bisect(A, mid*a) for a in A) < K:
                beg = mid
            else:
                end = mid

        return min((abs(a*mid - round(a*mid)), round(a*mid), a)  for a in A)[1:]
```

#### Code 2
Second binary search can be replaced with two pointers approach, so overall complexity is `O(n log T)`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log T)`, space is `O(n)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallestPrimeFraction(self, A, K):
        def count(m):
            j, cnt, n = len(A)-1, 0, len(A)
            for i in range(n):
                while j >= 0 and A[i] > m*A[n-1-j]: j-=1
                cnt += (j + 1)
            return cnt
        
        beg, end = 0, 1
        while end - beg > 1e-10:
            mid = (beg + end)/2
            if count(mid) < K:
                beg = mid
            else:
                end = mid

        return min((abs(a*mid - round(a*mid)), round(a*mid), a)  for a in A)[1:]
```

#### Remark
This problem actually is special case of Problem **0378** Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix and Problem **0373** Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums: there is `O((n+k)*log n)` heaps solution and even overkill solution with `O(n)` complexity.

One weakness in all method I have seen so far is that we are working with double numbers, so if two fractions `a1/b1` and `a2/b2` are very close, than solution will not work if constrains in our problem will be bigger. One solution I see is try to use modified binary search, where we have two fractions `a1/b1 < a2/b2` and we choose middle fraction as (a1+a2)/(b1+b2)`.
