#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/

#### Solution 1
Notice, that person with age `A` will request persons with age `B` if and only if:
1. if `A >= 100`, then `0.5A + 7 < B <= A`
2. if `A < 100`, then `0.5A + 7 < B < min(A, 100) = A`, which is exactly the same as previous condition, so actually third condition is redundant here.

So, what we can do is to sort our numbers and then do binary search. Notice also that person with age `<= 14` will not have any requests, because interval is empty.

#### Complexity
Time complexity will be `O(n log n)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
from bisect import bisect

class Solution:
    def numFriendRequests(self, ages):
        ages.sort()
        ans = 0
        for A in ages:
            if A >= 15:
                ans += (bisect(ages, A) - bisect(ages, A/2+7)) - 1
        return ans
```


#### Solution 2
There is also `O(n + A)` solution, where `A` is range of ages: count each age and then calculate number of connections for each age.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n + A)` for time and `O(A)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numFriendRequests(self, ages):
        cnt = [0]*121
        for a in ages: cnt[a] += 1    
        acc = list(accumulate(cnt))
        return sum(cnt[i] * (acc[i] - acc[i//2+7] - 1) for i in range(15, 121))
```
