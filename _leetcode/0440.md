#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-in-lexicographical-order/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-in-lexicographical-order/

#### Solution
Logical extension of Problem **0386**. Lexicographical Numbers.

Let `findStart(n, start)} be a function which evaluates number of numbers `<= n`, which starts from `start`. We can evaluate this function in `O(s)`, where `s` is length of number. 

Now, we can evaluate how many numbers starts with `1`, with `2`, and so on, with `9`, and we can understand which is the first digit, for example `3`, then we find how many numbers starts with `30`, `31` and so on `39`, find the second digit and so on. 

#### Complexity
Overall time complexity of algorithm is `O(9s^2) = O(9 * log^2n)`, space complexity is `O(s)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findKthNumber(self, n, k):
        def findStart(n, start):  #n, start: strings
            if n == start: return 1
            a, b = len(n), len(start)
            ans = (10**(a - b) - 1)//9
            if n.startswith(start):
                ans += int(n[b:]) + 1
            elif n[:b] > start:
                ans += 10**(a - b)
            return ans
        
        found = ""
        while k != 0:
            start = 1 if len(found) == 0 else 0
            k -= 1    #for number found itself
            for i in range(start, 10):   #check cases found + "0", ..., found + "9"
                att = findStart(str(n), str(found) + str(i))
                if att <= k:
                    k -= att
                else:
                    found += str(i)
                    break

        return int(found)
```

#### Remark
We can visualize our numbers as trie, where we need to find `k`- th element in in-order traversal.
