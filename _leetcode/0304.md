title: Leetcode 0304. Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable
tags: [dp]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-2d-immutable/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-2d-immutable/

#### Solution
The idea of this problem is similar to what we have in Sum Query 1D. Let us define by `self.dp[r+1][c+1]` sum of all numbers in rectangle `[0,r] x [0,c]`. We need `+1` here to deal with corner cases of empty rectangles. Then we can calculate all elements in `dp` table efficiently, using adjacent values. Also we can efficiently calculate sum in region now, similarly to 1D case.

#### Complexity
It is `O(MN)` time and space for initialization function and `O(1)` time and space for `sumRegion` function.

#### Code
```python
class NumMatrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix: List[List[int]]):
        M, N = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        self.dp = [[0] * (N+1) for _ in range(M+1)] 
        for c, r in product(range(N), range(M)):
            self.dp[r+1][c+1] = self.dp[r+1][c] + self.dp[r][c+1] - self.dp[r][c] + matrix[r][c]
    
    @lru_cache(None)
    def sumRegion(self, r1, c1, r2, c2):
        return self.dp[r2+1][c2+1] - self.dp[r1][c2+1] - self.dp[r2+1][c1] + self.dp[r1][c1]
```
