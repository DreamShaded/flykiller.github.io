#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/first-day-where-you-have-been-in-all-the-rooms/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/first-day-where-you-have-been-in-all-the-rooms/

#### Solution
The idea is that we need to go back a lot of times. Define by `dp[i]` is number of days to reach cell `i`. We can only reach it from the cell `i-1`, so we need at least `dp[i-1]` steps. Then it will lead us to `dp[A[i-1]]` cell, because we visited `i-1` for the first time. Then we need to reach `i-1` from `A[i-1]` again. And finally we need one more step. 

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def firstDayBeenInAllRooms(self, A):
        n, M = len(A), 10**9 + 7
        dp = [0]*n
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i] = (2*dp[i-1] - dp[A[i-1]] + 2) % M

        return dp[-1]  
```
