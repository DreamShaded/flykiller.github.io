#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-largest-value-in-each-tree-row/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-largest-value-in-each-tree-row/

#### Solution
Either use bfs approach with `O(n)` time and `O(W)` memory, or use dfs approach, where we keep layers maximal elements. However it is better idea to use `dfs` here.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is also `O(n)` and space complexity is `O(h)`, which we can not improve, because `h` is the size of output.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def largestValues(self, root):
        levels = []
        def dfs(node, k):
            if not node: return
            if len(levels) <= k:
                levels.append(node.val)
            else:
                levels[k] = max(levels[k], node.val)
            dfs(node.left, k+1)
            dfs(node.right, k+1)
            
        dfs(root, 0)
        return levels           
```
