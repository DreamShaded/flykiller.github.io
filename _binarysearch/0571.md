title: BinarySearch 0571 Palindrome Splitting
tags: [dp, string, palindrome]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Palindrome-Splitting/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Palindrome-Splitting/

#### Solution
We can use `dp` here, where `dp[i]` is number of ways to split `s[:i+1]`.

#### Complexity
Here complexity is `O(n^3)`, because we do a lot of check for palindromes, it can be made `O(n^2)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i == -1: return 1
            return sum(dp(j-1) for j in range(i+1) if s[j:i+1] == s[j:i+1][::-1])

        return dp(n - 1)
```
