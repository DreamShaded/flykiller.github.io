Just traverse our graph (which is tree) with dfs and return sum of all values for children.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def getImportance(self, employees, query_id):
        ids = {e.id: e for e in employees}
        
        def dfs(eid):
            employee = ids[eid]
            return (employee.importance + sum(dfs(eid) for eid in employee.subordinates))
        
        return dfs(query_id)
```
