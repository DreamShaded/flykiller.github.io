title: Leetcode 0354. Russian Doll Envelopes
tags: []
---

#### Problem statement:

You are given a 2D array of integers envelopes where `envelopes[i] = [wi, hi]` represents the width and the height of an envelope.

One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope is greater than the width and height of the other envelope.

Return the maximum number of envelopes can you Russian doll (i.e., put one inside the other).

#### Solution:

There is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={O(n^2)}"> solution, if we use similar idea of Problems **300** and **368**, because we want to find the longest increasing sub-sequence. Actually we can done exactly the same as in **300**,
 but when we sort we put envelopes with equal first elements `[6,8], [6,7]` it this **opposite order** 
: in this way we make sure that or longest increasing subsequence works like it is 
and we put into our `dp` table the second elements. For example if we have envelopes 
`[1,3],[3,5],[6,8],[6,7],[8,4],[9,5]`, we work with `[3,5,8,7,4,5]` and look for longest increasing 
sequence here.

#### Complexity:
Time complexity is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={O(n\log n)}">
 to sort our data, space complexity is
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={O(n)}">

```python
class Solution:
    def maxEnvelopes(self, envelopes):
        nums = sorted(envelopes, key = lambda x: [x[0], -x[1]])    
        dp = [10**10] * (len(nums) + 1)
        for elem in nums: dp[bisect_left(dp, elem[1])] = elem[1]  
        return dp.index(10**10)
```
