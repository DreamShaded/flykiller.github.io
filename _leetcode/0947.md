#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/most-stones-removed-with-same-row-or-column/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/most-stones-removed-with-same-row-or-column/

#### Solution 1
First solution is using idea of union find: we connect two stones if they have equal coordinate `x` or equal coordinate `y`. What is problem actually asking is number of connected components. We create graph with nodes: columns and rows `(x1, ..., xn, y1, ..., yn)`, where we say two nodes are connected if we have stone in the intersection of column and row (that is graph is bipartitie). We can decode comumns by shift by `N`, with big enough value. Then when we run

`for i, j in stones: dsu.union(i, j + N)`

in this line we add `N` edges to our graph. Finally we just check number of components.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` if we use DSU with ranks and path compressions.

#### Code
```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self, graph):
        self.p = {i:i for i in graph}

    def find(self, x):
        if self.p[x] != x:
            self.p[x] = self.find(self.p[x])
        return self.p[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        self.p[self.find(x)] = self.find(y)

class Solution:
    def removeStones(self, stones):
        N = 10000
        graph = [i for i, j in stones] + [j + N for i, j in stones]
        dsu = DSU(graph)
        for i, j in stones: dsu.union(i, j + N)
        groups = set(dsu.find(el) for el in graph)
        return len(stones) - len(groups)
```


#### Solution 2
We can solve this with dfs as well. We have two types of nodes: for every column create all possible connections for this column , same for row. In fact, no need to create all connections, we can only add connection between adjacent nodes in each column (and row). Like `(1, 1) - (3, 1) - (5, 1) - (10, 1)` for the second one and full 4-element graph for the first one. Not neccecarily sort each row\column, in this way we will have truly linear complexity: if we connect `(1, 1) -> (10, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (5, 1)` then components are still the same.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def removeStones(self, stones):
        def dfs(q):
            visited.add(q)
            for neib in graph[q]:
                if neib not in visited: dfs(neib)
            
        rows, cols = defaultdict(list), defaultdict(list)
        graph, visited, ans = defaultdict(list), set(), 0
        
        for i, j in stones:
            rows[i].append(j)
            cols[j].append(i)
            
        for r, k in rows.items():
            for i, j in zip(k, k[1:]):
                graph[r, i].append((r, j))
                graph[r, j].append((r, i))
        
        for c, k in cols.items():
            for i, j in zip(k, k[1:]):
                graph[i, c].append((j, c))
                graph[j, c].append((i, c))
                
        for i, j in stones:
            if (i, j) not in visited:
                dfs((i, j))
                ans += 1
                
        return len(stones) - ans
