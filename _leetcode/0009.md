tags: [math, palindrome]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/

#### Solution
As we can not convert to string, we can extract the last digit and create new number, and do it several times, like $12323 \to 1232, 1 \to 123, 12$, and finally we check that $12$ is $123$ with removed last digit.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is just $O(n)$, where $n$ is length of number, space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        if x < 0 or (x%10 == 0 and x != 0): return False
        
        rev = 0
        while x > rev:
            rev = rev*10 + x%10
            x //= 10

        return x == rev or x == rev//10
```
