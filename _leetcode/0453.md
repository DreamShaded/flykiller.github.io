tags: [math, array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements/

#### Solution
Increasing `n-1` numbers by `1` is equivalent decreasing one element by `1`. So, we need to find minimum element and decrease all others so they become equal to minimum. 

#### Complexity
We can write is as oneliner with `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums):
        return sum(nums) - len(nums)*min(nums)
```
