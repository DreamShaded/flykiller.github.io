#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Wildfire-Sequel/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Wildfire-Sequel/

#### Solution
The idea is to:
1. First run multi-source bfs from all fires and for each cell save the time when fire will reach this place.
2. Run bfs from person and allow him to only go to the cells where we do not have fire yet.

In fact we can make code compact if we use `bfs` function with `queue`: starting queue, `check` is used for the second pass.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, G):
        m, n, queue = len(G), len(G[0]), deque()
        for i,j in product(range(m), range(n)):
            if G[i][j] == 2: queue.append((0, i, j))
            if G[i][j] == 1: person = (i, j)
            
        times = defaultdict(lambda: float("inf"))

        def bfs(queue, check):
            V = set([(x, y) for _, x, y in queue])
            while queue:
                dist, x, y = queue.popleft()
                if check and x + y in [0, m + n - 2]: return True
                if not check: times[x, y] = dist
                for dx, dy in [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,1],[0,-1]]:
                    if 0<=x+dx<m and 0<=y+dy<n and G[x+dx][y+dy] in [0, 1] and (x+dx, y+dy) not in V:
                        if check and dist >= times[x+dx, y+dy]: continue
                        V.add((x + dx, y + dy))
                        queue.append((dist + 1, x+dx, y+dy))
            return False

        bfs(queue, False)
        return bfs(deque([(0,) + person]), True)
```
