#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/pour-water/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/pour-water/

#### Solution
Here we just need to do simulation of process: first try left direction and move `i` while it is not increasing. Also keep `best` position we will move only if our level decreased. Then do the same steps in right direction. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(Vn)`, space is `O(n)` to return answer. Good question, if we can do better.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def pourWater(self, heights, V, K):
        for _ in range(V):
            i, best, n = K, K, len(heights)
            for d in [-1,1]:
                while n > i+d >= 0 and heights[i+d] <= heights[i]:
                    if heights[i+d] < heights[i]: best = i +d
                    i += d
            heights[best] += 1
        
        return heights
```
