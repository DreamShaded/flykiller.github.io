#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/

#### Solution
Very similar to Problem **0056** Merge Intervals. One solution is just to sort all intervals and them go one by one with `O(n log n)` complexity, where `n` is total number of intervals. 

There is improvement with `O(n log k)` complexity, where `k` is number of employees. Our schedules are already sorted, so we keep always not more than `k` elements in our heap, each time extract smallest and add next one from this employer if we have it. Then we compare if `start < beg`, where `right` is our moving pointer, the place we reached so far and `beg` is start of new interval. If it is true, we add new gap. In any case we update our `right = max(right, end)`. In the end we need to deal with first interval which starts with minus infinity.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log k)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def employeeFreeTime(self, S):
        res, pq = [], []
        k, right = len(S), -float("inf")
        for i in range(k):
            heappush(pq, (S[i][0].start, S[i][0].end, i, 0))

        while pq:
            beg, end, ix, iy = heappop(pq)
            if right < beg:
                res.append([right, beg])

            right = max(right, end)
            if iy < len(S[ix]) - 1:
                heappush(pq, (S[ix][iy+1].start, S[ix][iy+1].end, ix, iy+1))

        return [Interval(a, b) for a, b in res[1:]]
```
