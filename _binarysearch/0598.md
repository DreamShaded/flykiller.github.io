#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Interval-Containing-One-Number/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Interval-Containing-One-Number/

#### Solution
What is actually need to be found is gap between two values with distance `2` in sorted array. Also we add sentinels.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        nums = sorted(set(nums + [0, 100001]))
        ans = 0
        for i in range(0, len(nums) - 2):
            ans = max(ans, nums[i+2] - nums[i] - 1)
        return ans
```
