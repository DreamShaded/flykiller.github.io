title: Leetcode 0441. Arranging Coins
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0441/
---

We need `1` coin for first level, `2` coins for second level and so on. So, if we have `s` layers, we need exactly `1+2+...+s = s*(s+1)/2` coins. Reformulating problem statement, we need to find the biggest `s`, such that `s*(s+1)/2 <= n` or `s^2 + s - 2n <= 0.` This is quadratic inequality, and to solve it we need to find roots of `s^2 + s - 2n = 0` equation first:

**Complexity**: both time and space is `O(1)`.

**Other solutions**: we can do it in `O(n)` with linear search, if we just add level by level. We can also use **binary search** with `O(log n)` complexity.


```python
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n):
        return int(sqrt(2*n + 0.25) - 0.5)
```
