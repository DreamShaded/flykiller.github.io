#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/

#### Solution
Similar to the previous problem, also 2 pointers idea. Now, instead of looking for sums equal to `target`, we perform 2 Pointers and look for sums which are around `target`, that is if sum becomes bigger than `target` we move end pointer and in opposite case we move beg pointer. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n^2)$, space is $O(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        nums.sort()
        n, ans = len(nums), float("inf")

        for i in range(n):
            beg, end = i + 1, n - 1

            while beg < end:
                sm = nums[beg] + nums[end] + nums[i]
                ans = min(ans, sm, key = lambda x: abs(x - target))
        
                if sm <= target:
                    beg += 1
                elif sm > target:
                    end -= 1

        return ans
```

There are couple of optimization to make it work faster: `if ans == target: break` before the last return statement, and not using lambda functions to get min.
