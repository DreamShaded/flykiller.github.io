Let us just put all sequences of length `10` into list, then apply counter: count how many times each element is present and finally return elements with frequency more than `1`.

**Complexity**: Time and space complexity is `O(10n)`: ther will be `O(n)` substrings of length `10`.

```python
class Solution:
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s):
        Count = Counter(s[i-10:i] for i in range(10, len(s) + 1))
        return [key for key in Count if Count[key] > 1]   
```

**Remark** When I saw this problem, my first idea was to use rolling hash, which potentially can give us `O(n)` instead of `O(10n)` complexity. However we need not only evaluate how many repeated substrings of length `10` we have, but also return them all. This potentially can spend `O(n)` time: imagine example:
`TT`, where `T` is string of length `n/2`. Then if all substring in `T` are different, we have `O(n/2)` different substings, we need to return, which gives us `O(5n)` space complexity of output.
