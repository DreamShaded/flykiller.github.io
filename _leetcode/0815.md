#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/bus-routes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/bus-routes/

#### Solution
Idea here is to work with buses, not with stops. Let `n` be number of buses and `x1, x2, ..., xn` be number of stops in paths. Then, let us first create for each unique stop list of buses, which visit this stop in `O(x1 + ... + xn)`, then for each stop we create all pairs of transfers.

#### Complexity
Theoretically complexity is `O((x1 + ... + xn) * n^2)`, but in practice it is usually much less. Space complexity is `O(n^2)`. Good question, if we can reduce the biggest part of complexity to make it smaller? Space complexity is `O(n^2)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numBusesToDestination(self, routes, S, T):
        if S == T: return 0
        
        stops = defaultdict(set)  #stops -> list of buses
        for i, route in enumerate(routes):
            for stop in route:
                stops[stop].add(i)
                
        transfers = defaultdict(set)
        for i in stops:
            for st1, st2 in permutations(stops[i], 2):
                transfers[st1].add(st2)
                
        beg, end = stops[S], stops[T]
        queue = deque((1, i) for i in beg)
        visited = set([0])
        
        while queue:
            steps, bus = queue.popleft()
            if bus in end: return steps
            for neib in transfers[bus]:
                if neib not in visited:
                    visited.add(neib)
                    queue.append((steps + 1, neib))
                    
        return -1
```

#### Remark
There are a bit different ways how we can perform bfs, we can do it on stations as well.
