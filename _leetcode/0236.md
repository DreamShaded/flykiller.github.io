#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/

#### Solution
The idea is to traverse our tree and keep auxilary function `dfs(node)`, which returns `0` if subtree do not have desired nodes and `1` if it has (one or two of them). For given `node`, we calculate information about:
1. `lft` is `dfs(node.left)`, that is answer for left subtree.
2. `rgh` is `dfs(node.right)`, that is answer for right subtree.
3. `mid` is true if current node is either `p` or `q`.

Then what we need to find is such node, for which at least `2` out of these `3` values are true. Why? If `p` is parent of `q`, then the answer is `p` and we have `mid = 1` and one of the `lft` and `rgh` equal to `1`. If `q` is parent of `p`, it is similar. If we have `h` which is LCA of `p` and `q`, then for `h` we have `lft = rgh = 1` and `mid = 0`.

#### Complexity
 Complexity is `O(n)`, both time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return 0

            lft = dfs(node.left)
            rgh = dfs(node.right)
            mid = node in [p, q]
            if lft + rgh + mid >= 2:
                self.Found = node

            return max(lft, mid, rgh)
        
        self.Found = None
        dfs(root)
        return self.Found
```
