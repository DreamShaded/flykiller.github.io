#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-words-for-each-puzzle/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-words-for-each-puzzle/

#### Solution 1
One way to solve this problem is to find `diff`: step of our progression and then find missing number.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, arr):
        diff = (arr[-1] - arr[0])//(len(arr))
        if diff == 0: return arr[0]
        real = set(range(arr[0], arr[-1] + diff, diff))
        return list(real - set(arr))[0]
```

#### Solution 2
There is better solution, using binary search. The idea is to check if number we see on the place `mid` is what we expected to see. Depending on this we go to the left or to the right half.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, arr):
        diff = (arr[-1] - arr[0])//(len(arr))
        beg, end = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if arr[mid] == arr[0] + mid*diff:
                beg = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid
                
        return arr[0] + diff * beg
```
