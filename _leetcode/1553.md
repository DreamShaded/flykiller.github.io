#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-eat-n-oranges/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-eat-n-oranges/

#### Solution
Imagine that we do not have first option and instead when we have `3k+2` oranges we can go to `k` oranges making `3` steps. Then we can easily solve it with dp.

#### Complexity
Complexity is `O(log N^2)`, because we have recurence `T(n) = T(n//2) + T(n//3) + 1`. Why? On the first level we have `N`, then we have `N//2, N//3`. Then we have `N//2//2, N//2//3 = N//3//2, N//3//3`. Here we use the property that `N//a//b = N//b//a = N//a*b`. On i-th level we have no more than i+1 values, and we can have `O(log n)` levels, so we have complexity like this.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, n):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i <= 2: return i
            return min(dp(i//2) + i%2 + 1, dp(i//3) + i%3 + 1)
        
        return dp(n)
```
