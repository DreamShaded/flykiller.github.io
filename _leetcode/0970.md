#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/powerful-integers/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/powerful-integers/

#### Solution
In this problem we need to find number of solutions of `x**i + y**j <= bound` with given `x, y, bound`. What we can do is just check all possible solutions: in fact there will be not a lot of different solutions, we discuss it in complexity section. Here what we do is to generate all possible powers of `x` and `y`, which are smaller than `bound` and check all pairs. Be careful with case `x = 1` or `y = 1` to avoid infinite loop.

#### Complexity
There will be `O(log_x(bound)) = O(log(bound))` options to choose power of `x`, and in the same way there will be  `O(log_y(bound)) = O(log(bound))` options for power of `y`. So, it total, there will be `O(log^2(bound))` pairs which we check, which is not very big number. Space complexity is the same.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def powerfulIntegers(self, x, y, bound):
        pow_x, pow_y = [1], [1]
        while pow_x[-1]*x < bound and x > 1: pow_x.append(pow_x[-1]*x)
        while pow_y[-1]*y < bound and y > 1: pow_y.append(pow_y[-1]*y)
        return {i+j for i, j in product(pow_x, pow_y) if i + j <= bound}
```
