title: Leetcode 0809 Expressive Words
tags: [string, groupby]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/expressive-words/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/expressive-words/

#### Solution
What we need to do is group symbols in groups, using for example `groupby`. Then we iterate over `words` and for each `word` we check first if lengths are the same, and then go symbol by symbol: if they are not equal, return `False` immediately. If symbols are equal, but length in `word` is more than in `S` we also return `False`. Finally, if length is less, but they are equal to `1` and `2`, we also return `False`, because group should have size `3` or more. If everything passed, we return `True`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(S1 + S2 + ...  + Sn + T)`, where `S1, ..., Sn` are lengths of `word` in `words`, `T` is length of `S`; space complexity is `O(max Si + T)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def expressiveWords(self, S, words):
        def group(s): 
            return [(i, len(list(j))) for i, j in groupby(s)] 

        def check(gr1, gr2):
            if len(gr1) != len(gr2): return False
            for (i1, i2), (j1, j2) in zip(gr1, gr2):
                if i1 != j1: return False
                if i2 < j2 or i2 == 2 and j2 == 1: return False
            return True

        s_group = group(S)
        return sum(check(s_group, group(word)) for word in words)
```
