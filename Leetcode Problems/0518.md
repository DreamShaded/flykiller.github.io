title: Leetcode 0518. Coin Change 2
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0518/

Let `dp_sum[i][j]` be a number of ways to represent amount `i` such that we use only first `j` coins. We initialize the first column of this table with `1`, because we can say there is one way to get `amount = 0`, using first `j` coins: do not take any coins.
To find `dp_sum[i][j]` we need to look at the last coin taken, it consists of two terms:
1. `dp_sum[i][j-1]`, number of options, where we take only first `j-1` coins
2. `dp_sum[i-coins[j]][j]`, number of options, where we removed coin number `j` and we need to find number of options for the rest amount.

**Example**: let us consider `coins = [1,2,5]` and amont = 5. Then table `dp_sum` will be equal to
|             | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **coin #0 (1)** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **coin #1 (2)** | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| **coin #2 (5)** | 1 | 1| 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

**Complexity** time and space is `O(amount *N)`, where `N` is number of different coins, because we need only `O(1)` to update each cell.

In code I use index `i+1` instead of `i`, because we start from `1`st column, not `0`th.

**Update** Space complexity can be reduced to `O(amount)`, because for every `j` we look at most one row back.

```
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount, coins):
        N = len(coins)
        if N == 0: return int(N == amount)
        
        dp_sum = [[0] * N for _ in range(amount + 1)]
        for i in range(N): dp_sum[0][i] = 1
        
        for i,j in product(range(amount), range(N)):
            dp_sum[i+1][j] = dp_sum[i+1][j-1]
            if i+1 - coins[j] >= 0:
                dp_sum[i+1][j] += dp_sum[i+1-coins[j]][j]           
                    
        return dp_sum[-1][-1]
```

#### Solution 2

This is classical problem for generation functions: you can see this example on wikipedia: number of ways to make change (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_generating_functions).

Howerer the main difficulty here is to make it work in time. What I did is I choose `x = 2^32`, spend like 4 hours, trying different ways to multiply polynomials, using convolutions and optimizing code to avoid TLE and here is the result.

**Update**: 

Let us go through example `target = 5` and `coins = [1, 2, 5]`
1. We build 3 generating polynoms: `1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5`, `1+x^2+x^4` and `1+x^5`. What we need to do now is to multiply these polynomials and evaluate coefficient before term with degree `target`. Indeed:
`(1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5)*(1+x^2+x^4)*(1+x^5) = ... + x*x^4*1 + 1*1*x^5 + x^3*x^2*1 + x^5*1*1`, there is `4` possible ways to get degree `5`. 
2. Note, that if all coefficients are less than some big number `N`, say `N=1000` for example and `polynom = 13x^2 + 6x + 3`, than `polynom(1000) = 13006003`, so we can easily distinguish coefficients for each degree, if we look at our number as number in base `1000`. 
3. To make it faster we use the fact `(1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5) = (x^6-1)/(x-1)`, `(1+x^2+x^4) = (x^6-1)/(x^2-1)` and `1+x^5=(x^10-1)/(x^5-1)`.
4. We take `N=2^32`, because it is given in statement that we can never get numbers more than `N`.
5. Substitute `N=2^32` into our polynom and evaluate it! Python allows as to do computations of big numbers.
6. Optimisations: use a lot of bit manipulations to avoid TLE.


```
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount, coins):
        S = [(((1<<(32*(amount//i*i + i)))) - 1)//((1<<(i*32)) - 1) for i in coins]
        prodd = 1
        
        for i in S: prodd = (prodd * i) & ((1<<((amount +1)*32))-1)
        return prodd>>(32*amount)
```

We can write it as Oneliners in the following ways - thanks **https://leetcode.com/joric/** for this!

```
return reduce(lambda p,i:(p*i)&(1<<((amount+1)*32))-1,[((1<<(32*(amount//i*i+i)))-1)//((1<<(i*32))-1) for i in coins],1)>>(32*amount)
```

```python
return list(accumulate(coins,lambda p,i:(p*(((1<<(32*(amount//i*i+i)))-1)//((1<<(i*32))-1)))&((1<<((amount+1)*32))-1),initial=1))[-1]>>(32*amount)
```
