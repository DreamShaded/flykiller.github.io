tags: [string, math]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-in-the-minimum-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-in-the-minimum-number/

#### Solution
We just do what is asked: find minimum number and find sum of digits.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n = len(nums)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sumOfDigits(self, nums):
        return 1 - sum(int(i) for i in str(min(nums))) % 2
```
