#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Look-and-Say/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Look-and-Say/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0038. Count and Say

#### Complexity
Potentially sequence can extend upto `O(2^n)` elements, so we have `O(2^n)` time and space complexity.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        state = "1"
        for _ in range(n-1):
            state = "".join([str(len(list(j))) + str(i) for i, j in groupby(state)])
        return state
```
