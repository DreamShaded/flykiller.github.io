#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-at-a-given-index-in-a-bounded-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-at-a-given-index-in-a-bounded-array/

#### Solution
The idea is to use binary search where `test(a)` is answer for the question if we can build array such that `nums[index] = a`. How we are going to check if we can construct is to use greedy strategy: go to the left with values `a-1, a-2, ... ` and then go to the right with the same values. We can have two cases for each of the sides: if we reach `0` or we our of indexes. Also by problem definition elements should be `>=1`, so it is easier to subtract `1` from all element in the beginning.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxValue(self, n, index, maxSum):
        def test(a):
            b = max(a - index, 0)
            res = (a + b) * (a - b + 1) // 2
            b = max(a - ((n - 1) - index), 0)
            res += (a + b) * (a - b + 1) // 2
            return res - a <= maxSum

        maxSum -= n
        beg, end = 0, maxSum + 1
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end) // 2
            if test(mid):
                beg = mid
            else:
                end = mid
        return end
```
