#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/baseball-game/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/baseball-game/

#### Solution
Not very clear what to do, but when you realize it is quite easy. Just do what is asked, using stack: if we have `+`, we need to add sum of two last elements into stack. If we have `C`, we remove last element. If we have `D`, we add doubled last element. If we have number, we just append it.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def calPoints(self, ops):
        stack = []
        for op in ops:
            if op == '+':
                stack.append(stack[-1] + stack[-2])
            elif op == 'C':
                stack.pop()
            elif op == 'D':
                stack.append(2 * stack[-1])
            else:
                stack.append(int(op))

        return sum(stack)
```
