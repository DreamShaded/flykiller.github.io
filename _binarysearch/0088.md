#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sort-by-Frequency-and-Value/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sort-by-Frequency-and-Value/

#### Solution
Use counter and then sort values in given order, then reconstruct answer.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        cnt = sorted([(-y, -x) for x, y in Counter(nums).items()])
        ans = []
        for y, x in cnt:
            ans += [-x]*(-y)
        return ans
```
