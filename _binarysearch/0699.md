#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sum-of-Four-Numbers-Less-Than-Target/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sum-of-Four-Numbers-Less-Than-Target/

#### Solution
First, we can create all sums from `A` and `B` and sort them. Then we can use binary search to find for each sum in `C` and `D`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2 log n)` fo time and `O(n^2)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A, B, C, D, target):
        ab = sorted(a + b for a in A for b in B)
        return sum(bisect.bisect(ab, target - c - d) for c in C for d in D)
```
