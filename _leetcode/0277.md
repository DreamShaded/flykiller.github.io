#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-celebrity/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-celebrity/

#### Solution
Let us keep `cand`: possible candidate for celebrity. Let us consider persons one by one. If `knows(cand, i)` is true, it means that `cand` can not be celebrity any more, so we need to change it. If it is false, it means that `i` can not be celebrity, becaouse everone knows celebrity, so in any case we have only one candidate rest. In the end we need to check that `cand` is indeed celebrity, what we did so far is just make sure that others can not be celebrities. So, we check all `2n - 2` connections.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$, in the worst case it can be $3n$. Space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findCelebrity(self, n):
        cand = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if knows(cand, i): cand = i
            
        for i in range(n):
            if i == cand: continue
            if not knows(i, cand) or knows(cand, i): return -1
            
        return cand
```
