#### Problem statement

#### Solution

This is quite difficult problem, which can be solved with dymamic programming. As usual let us define `dp[i]` the length of the longest valid substring ending at `i`-th index. We can have several cases now:
1. If `i == -1`, it means we reached empty string, return `0`, answer for empty string. Also if `s[i] = (`, answer is also `0`, because no valid parantheses can end with `(`
2. Now, we have case, when `s[i] = )`. Let us look at the previous element. If it is equal to `(`, then we have `()` as two last elements and we can return `dp(i-2) + 2`.
3. Now consider the case, when `s[i-1] = )`, it means, that we have the following situation: `...))`. If we want to find the longest valid parentheses for `i`, first we need to deal with `i-1`. Define `P = i - dp(i-1) - 1`. Then we have the following situation:

`...((.....))`

`...P.......i`

Here on the top is the structure of string and in the bottom are indexes. String from `P + 1` to `i - 1` indexes including is the longest valid parentheses endind with `i-1` place. What we can say about place `P`. If we have `)` element on this place, then we need to return `0`: in this case we have patten `...)(...))...` and we **know** that answer for `dp(P)` is equal to `0`: if it is not, what we considered was not the longest answer for `i-1`. And if answer for `dp(P)` is zero, than answer for `dp(i)` is zero as well.
In the case, when we have `...((.....))`, answer is `dp(i-1) + dp(P-1) + 2`. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n)$, space complexity as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i == -1 or s[i] == "(": return 0
            if i >= 1 and s[i-1:i+1] == "()": return dp(i-2) + 2
            P = i - dp(i-1) - 1
            if P >= 0 and s[P] == "(":
                return dp(i-1) + dp(P-1) + 2
            return 0
            
        return max(dp(i) for i in range(len(s))) if s else 0
```
