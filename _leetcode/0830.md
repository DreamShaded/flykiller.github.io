title: Leetcode 0830 Positions of Large Groups
tags: [two pointers, groupby, accumulate]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/positions-of-large-groups/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/positions-of-large-groups/

#### Solution
What we need to find are places of groups with equal elements with size `>=3`. We can use functionality of python to evaluate sizes of groups and then use cumulative sums to directly get intervals.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def largeGroupPositions(self, s):
        t = [len(list(j)) for i, j in groupby(s)]
        return [[num-t[i], num-1] for i, num in enumerate(accumulate(t)) if t[i]>= 3]
```

#### Remark
Also we can just use two pointers approach with sliding window.
