title: Leetcode 0316. Remove Duplicate Letters
tags: []
---

Let us try to build our answer in greedy way: we take letter by letter and put them into stack: if we have next letter which decreased lexicographical order of string, we remove it from stack and put new letter. However we need to be careful: if we remove some letter from stack and it was the last occurence, then we failed: we can not finish this process. So, we need to do the following:

1. Find `last_occ`: last occurences for each letter in our string
2. Initialize our `stack` either as empty or with symbol, which is less than any letter ('!' in my case), so we do not need to deal with the case of empty stack. Also initialize `Visited` as empty set.
3. Iterate over our string and if we already have symbol in `Visited`, we just continue.
4. Then, we try to remove elements from the top of our stack: we do it, if new symbol is less than previous and also if last occurence of last symbol is more than `i`: it means that we have removed symbol later in our string, so if we remove it we will not fail to constract full string.
5. Append new symbol to our stack and mark it as visited.
6. Finally, return string built from our stack.

**Complexity**: Time complexity is `O(n)`, because we iterate our string once. Space complexity is `O(26)`, because it will be the longest size of our stack and answer.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s):
        last_occ = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        stack = ["!"]
        Visited = set()
        
        for i, symbol in enumerate(s):
            if symbol in Visited: continue
            
            while (symbol < stack[-1] and last_occ[stack[-1]] > i):
                Visited.remove(stack.pop())
           
            stack.append(symbol)
            Visited.add(symbol)        
        return "".join(stack)[1:]
```
