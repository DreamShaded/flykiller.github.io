We can just split our string, remove all extra spaces and return length of the last word, however we need to spend `O(n)` time for this, where `n` is length of our string. There is a simple optimization: let us traverse string from the end and:
1. find the last element of last word: traverse from the end and find first non-space symbol.
2. continue traverse and find first space symbol (or beginning of string)
3. return `end` - `beg`.

**Complexity**: is `O(m)`, where `m` is length of part from first symbol of last word to the end. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        end = len(s) - 1
        while end > 0 and s[end] == " ": end -= 1
        beg = end
        while beg >= 0 and s[beg] != " ": beg -= 1
        return end - beg
```
