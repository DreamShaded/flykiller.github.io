#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Overchoice/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Overchoice/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1087 Brace Expansion.

#### Complexity
Time complexity to create `t` is `O(n)`, but then we need to create answer as well. Potentially it can be upto `O(2^(n/5))` for the case with two letters in each brackets.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        t = []
        parts = s.replace("[", "]").split("]")
        for part in parts:
            if not part: continue
            t.append(sorted(part.split("|")))

        return ["".join(x) for x in product(*t)]
```
