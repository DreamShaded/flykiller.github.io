#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-ii/

#### Solution
Let `dp(i, M)` be the maximum gain the if the first player have piles left `[i, ... ]` and he can take `>= M` of them. Then how many stones he can get? We can look at place `j` from `i + 1` to `i + 2*M + 1` and we can have `sum(A[i:]) - gain of the second player`, which can be evaluated as `dp(j, max(M, j - i))`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^3)` for time and `O(n^2)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def stoneGameII(self, A):
        n, acc = len(A), [0] + list(accumulate(A))

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, M):
            res = 0
            for j in range(i + 1, min(2 * M + i + 1, n + 1)):
                res = max(res, acc[-1] - acc[i] - dp(j, max(M, j - i)))
            return res

        return dp(0, 1)
```
