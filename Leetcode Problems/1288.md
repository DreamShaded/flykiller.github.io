title: Leetcode 1288. Remove Covered Intervals
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1288/
---

Let us sort our intervals by their starts and traverse them one by one (if we have the same ends, we first choose intervals with smaller ends, so they will be traversed first) Also let us keep `right` variable, which will be the biggest right end of interval so far. So, what does it mean that one interval is covered by some other? It means that `end <= right`: we have some previous interval with end more than current end and start which is less than current interval.

**Complexity**: for time complexity we sort intervals in `O(n log n)` and then traverse them in `O(n)`. Space complexity is `O(n)` if we are not allowed to change `intervals` and `O(log n)` we are allowed to modify `intervals`.

```
class Solution:
    def removeCoveredIntervals(self, intervals):
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        right, rem, n = -1, 0, len(intervals)
        for _, end in intervals:
            if end <= right:
                rem += 1
            else:
                right = end
        return n - rem
```
