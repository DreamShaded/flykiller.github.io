#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-stay-in-the-same-place-after-some-steps/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-stay-in-the-same-place-after-some-steps/

#### Solution
Just do dp with state `(index, steps done)`. Note, that on each step we can have `3` possible options, and also that it does no matter that `m` be quite big, we never need to traverse more than half of `n`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*min(n, m))`, where `n = steps` and `m = arrLen`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, steps, arrLen):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(ind, s):
            if not 0 <= ind < arrLen: return 0
            if s == 0: return ind == 0
            return (dp(ind-1, s-1) + dp(ind, s-1) + dp(ind+1, s-1)) % MOD
        
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        return dp(0, steps)
```
