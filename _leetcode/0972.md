title: Leetcode 0972. Equal Rational Numbers
tags: [math, parser]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-rational-numbers/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-rational-numbers/

#### Solution
What we need to do in our problem is to parse our number and we can have several parts:
`a` is integer part, `b` is preperiod and `c` is period. Then we need to create rational number from this values. Imagine that `c = 13`, than in fact it is fraction `13/99`. Then we need to do some math to calculate full fraction. In the end compare fractions.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n + m)` for time and space, where `n` and `m` are lengths of `S` and `T`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isRationalEqual(self, S, T):
        def MakeRat(S):
            b, c = "", ""
            if "." not in S: 
                a = S
            else:
                a, b = S.split(".")
                if "(" in S:
                    b, c = b.split("(")
                    c = c[:-1]
        
            l1, l2 = len(b), len(c)
            if b == "": b = "0"
            if c == "": c = "0"
            a, b, c = int(a), int(b), int(c)
            P2 = 10**l2 - 1 if l2 > 0 else 1
            
            return (a*10**l1*P2 + b*P2 + c, 10**l1*P2)
        
        (x1, y1), (x2, y2) = MakeRat(S), MakeRat(T)

        return x1*y2 == x2*y1
```
