tags: [hash table, counter]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-completing-word/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-completing-word/

#### Solution
Just use counters and `lower` functionality. Iterate over `words` and check if it is good, using difference of counters trick.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(m)`, where `m` is total length of all words in `words` and `licensePlate`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCompletingWord(self, licensePlate, words):
        count = Counter("".join(s for s in licensePlate.lower() if s.isalpha()))
        return min([w for w in words if not count - Counter(w)], key = len)

```
