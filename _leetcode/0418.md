#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-screen-fitting/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-screen-fitting/

#### Solution
We can do it word by word, but it can be potentially too slow. Let us merge all words into sequence with spaces, for example "I have a cat ". Then we try to traverse line by line, how we do it? We have `start` value, which indicates  how much symbols we traverse. For each line we do `start += cols`. Then we evaluate `seq[start \% N]`, where `N` is length of our concatenated string. If we have space, we can safely go the the next line and we just do `start += 1`. If symbol is not space, we go back until we meet space symbol. In the end we return `start//N`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is is $O(cols + N)$, space complexity is $O(N)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def wordsTyping(self, sentence, rows, cols):
        seq = " ".join(sentence) + " "
        N, start = len(seq), 0
        for i in range(rows):
            start += cols
            if seq[start % N] == " ":
                start += 1
            else:
                while start > 0 and seq[(start-1)%N] != " ":
                    start -=1
        return start // N
```
