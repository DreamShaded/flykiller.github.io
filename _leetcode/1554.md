#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/strings-differ-by-one-character/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/strings-differ-by-one-character/

#### Solution
One idea is for each word `abcd` create words `#bcd, a#cd, ab#d, abc#` and put them to set. 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n*m^2)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def differByOne(self, dct):
        n, m = len(dct), len(dct[0])
        cnt = set()
        for word in dct:
            for i in range(m):
                cand = word[:i] + "#" + word[i+1:]
                if cand in cnt: return True
                cnt.add(cand)
                
        return False
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(nm)` in average time complexity solution, if we use rolling hashes. The idea is to calculate hashes for each string and then for each of `m` possible hashes check if we have 
1) pair of strings which differ by element with index `0`.
2) pair of strings which differ by element with index `1` and so on.
