title: Leetcode 0190. Reverse Bits
tags: []
---

We are asked to reverse bits in our number. What is the most logical way to do it? Create number `out`, process original number bit by bit from end and add this bit to the end of our `out` number, and that is all! Why it is works? 
1. `out = (out << 1)^(n & 1)` adds last bit of `n` to `out`
2. `n >>= 1` removes last bit from `n`.

Imagine number `n = 11011010`, and `out = 0`
1. `out = 0`, `n = 1101101`
2. `out = 01`, `n = 110110`
3. `out = 010`, `n = 11011`
4. `out = 0101`, `n = 1101`
5. `out = 01011`, `n = 110`
6. `out = 010110`, `n = 11`
7. `out = 0101101`, `n = 1`
8. `out = 01011011`, `n = 0` 

**Compexity**: time complexity is `O(32)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

**Follow up** There is `O(5)` smart solution which quite impressive, see the most voted post in discussion by @tworuler. We also can hash some `8`-bits parts, so we can inverse `4` parts on the fly, with time complexity `O(4)` and memory complexity `O(256)` (and preprocessing `O(256)` as well).



```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n):
        out = 0
        for i in range(32):
            out = (out << 1)^(n & 1)
            n >>= 1
        return out
```
