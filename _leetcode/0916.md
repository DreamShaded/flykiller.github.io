The idea here is to use counters: we need to find elements from `A`, for which each string from `B` have less or equal frequencies for each symbol. Let us create `cnt`: counter, with maximal values for each letter, that is if we have `B = [abb, bcc]`, then we have `cnt = {a:1, b:2 ,c:2}`. In python it can be written using `|` symbol. 

Second step is for each string `a` from `A` calcuate counter and check that it is bigger for each element than `cnt`. Again in python it can be don in very short way, using `not cnt - Counter(a)`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(m + n)`, where `m` is total length of words in `A` and `m` is total length of words in `n`. Space complexity is `O(m)`, because potentially answe can consist all strings from `A`.

```python
class Solution:
    def wordSubsets(self, A, B):
        cnt = Counter()
        for b in B:
            cnt |= Counter(b)
            
        return [a for a in A if not cnt - Counter(a)]
```
