title: Leetcode 0974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K
tags: [accumulate, counter]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/

#### Solution
All we need to do is to evaluate cumulative sums and then for every reminder `d` with frequency `x` evaluate number `x * (x - 1)//2`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def subarraysDivByK(self, nums, k):
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
        cnt = Counter()
        for x in acc:
            cnt[x%k] += 1
            
        return sum(x*(x-1)//2 for x in cnt.values())
```
