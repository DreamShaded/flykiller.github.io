tags: [math, string, palindrome]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome/

#### Solution
First of all, there is not more than `5` candidates we need to consider for number `n`. Let us cut first half and denote this number by `half`. For example for `1234567` it will be `1234` and for `123456` it will be `123`. Then we need to consider numbers `half - 1, half, half + 1` and reconstruct palindromes from them: I use two functions: `Co(q)` and `Ce(q)`. Also we need to consider numbers `99...99` and `100...001`. 

#### Complexity
Overall time and space complexity is `O(k)`, where `k` is length of number `n`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def nearestPalindromic(self, n):
        def Co(q): return int(str(q) + str(q)[::-1])
        def Ce(q): return int(str(q) + str(q)[:-1][::-1])
        k = len(n)
        if k % 2 == 0:
            half = int(n[:k//2])
            c1, c2, c3 = Co(half), Co(half-1), Co(half+1)
        else:
            half = int(n[:k//2+1])
            c1, c2, c3 = Ce(half), Ce(half-1), Ce(half+1)
        
        cands = set([10**k+1, 10**(k-1)-1]) | set([c1, c2, c3])
        cands.discard(int(n))
       
        return str(min(cands, key = lambda x: [abs(x-int(n)), x]))      
```
