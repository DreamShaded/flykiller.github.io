#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement-ii/

#### Solution
Just create sentence `1,2, . . . , n-k, n, n-k+ 1, n-1, . . .`, where we start to take biggest and smallest elements from place `n-k`.  Let us consider case `n = 14` and `k = 6`, then what  `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,14,9,13,10,12,11]`: then first differences are equal to `1`, then we have differencese `6, -5, 4, -3, 2, -1`, so in the end we will have absolute differences `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space as well to form output array

#### Code
```
class Solution:
    def constructArray(self, n, k):
        dr, diff = 1, k
        result = list(range(1, n-k+1))
        for i in range(k):
            result.append(result[-1] + dr*diff)
            dr *= -1
            diff -= 1      
        return result
```
