#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unique-characters-of-all-substrings-of-a-given-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unique-characters-of-all-substrings-of-a-given-string/

#### Solution
Let us inverse this problem and do it in the following way: for every symbol we will count number of substrings, for which it is unique. For example for word `LEETCODE` for symbol `E` we have positions `1, 2, 7`. What we need to do: add also positions `-1` and `n` here, where `n` is length of string, so we have `-1,1, 2, 7, 8` now, evaluate differences between adjacent elements: `2, 1, 5, 1` and now evaluate sum of products of adjacent elements: `2 x 1 + 1 x 5 + 5 x 1 = 12`. Why so? Because for each index we can go several place to the left and several places to the right.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, because we deal with each index only once, space complexity is `O(n)` as well. 

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def uniqueLetterString(self, s):
        positions = defaultdict(list)
        n, ans = len(s), 0
        for i, elem in enumerate(s):
            positions[elem].append(i)
            
        for letter, pos in positions.items():
            diffs = list(x-y for x,y in zip(pos + [n], [-1] + pos))
            ans += sum(x*y for x,y in zip(diffs[1:], diffs[:-1]))
            
        return ans % (10**9 + 7)
```
