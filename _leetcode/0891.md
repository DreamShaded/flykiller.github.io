#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subsequence-widths/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subsequence-widths/

#### Solution
The will be $2^n$ subsequences, so there is no way we can directly check all of them. Instead, let us sort numbers and try to understand how many times each of them will be in final sum. Let us look at `a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= a4` case. How many times `a1` will be here? It will be `2^3` times as maximum and `2^0` times as minimum. `a2` will be `2^2` times as maximum and `2^1` times as minimum. `a3` will be `2^1` times as maximum and `2^2` times as minimum and finally `a4` will be `2^0` times as maximum and `2^3` times as minimum. So, for this case we can say that answer is `7a1 + 2a2 - 2a3 - 7a4`. Exactly the same logic can be used for `n` numbers, but we need to calculate coefficients modulo `10^9 + 7`. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity will be `O(n log n)`: to sort numbers and smaller `O(n)` to calculate linear combination. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sumSubseqWidths(self, A):
        n, M = len(A), 10**9 + 7
        coeff = [1]
        for i in range(n-1): coeff += [coeff[-1]*2%M]
        coeff = [i-j for i,j in zip(coeff, coeff[::-1])]
        return sum(x*y for x,y in zip(coeff, sorted(A))) % M
```
