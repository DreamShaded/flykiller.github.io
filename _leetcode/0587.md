#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/erect-the-fence/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/erect-the-fence/

#### Solution 1
What we actually need to find is convex hull of given points. There are different ways how to do it: the simplest is Jarvis Algorithm with `O(mn)` complexity, where `n` is total number of points and `m` is number of points in convex hull. I prefer **Graham scan**, which use the idea of angle sweep. We need to choose the most left point as starting point. Then we need to sort points with respect to its angle, and if we have the same angle, then we need to sort points by **(-p[1], p[0])** - in this way we can be sure that we traverse points in correct order, also we need to make sure that for the first points if they have the same angle, we need to sort them in **increasing order by distance** and for the last one in the **decreasing order by distance**. I did not found elegant way to code this, so what I do is just check last points and look for points lying on the same line and then sort them in correct way. Then we keep stack with points and check orientation of triangle, using `cross` function and if orientation is negative, then we pop the point `ans[-2]`. Please go to wikipedia for more details.

Note, that in this problem our convex hull contains point on border, if we do not need it we need to use  `cross(*ans[-3:]) <= 0` instead and `points.sort(key=lambda p: (atan2(p[1]-start[1], p[0]-start[0]), p[0]))`, I am not 100 sure though, I did not test it a lot.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def outerTrees(self, points):
        def cross(p1, p2, p3):
            return (p2[0]-p1[0])*(p3[1]-p1[1])-(p2[1]-p1[1])*(p3[0]-p1[0])

        start = min(points)
        points.pop(points.index(start))
        points.sort(key=lambda p: (atan2(p[1]-start[1], p[0]-start[0]), -p[1], p[0]))
        
        last = len(points) - 1
        while last > 0 and cross(start, points[-1], points[last - 1]) == 0:
            last -= 1
            
        points[last:] = sorted(points[last:], key = lambda p: (-p[0]))

        ans = [start]
        for p in points:
            ans.append(p)
            while len(ans) > 2 and cross(*ans[-3:]) < 0:
                ans.pop(-2)
        return ans
```

#### Solution 2
When I solved this problem, I was not fully satisfied, because of `atan2` function: given problem constraints, all absolute values `<= 100` it will work fine. But if we have bigger coordinates, it can wrong incorrectly, because `3` points can lie almost on the same line and we can not be sure if it is convex or concave. To compare points we need to first check the quater it is inside and then if they are in the same quater, check `p1[1]/p1[0] > p2[1]/p2[0]`, which can be written without divisions. Function `compare` will compare points, usch that angle lies in (-180, 180) without rounding errors.

Now, we use the similar logic as in solution 1, but we need to **normalize** points, that is subtract `start` from all of them, then perfrom sort and in the end add `start` back.

#### Complexity
It is still `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def outerTrees(self, points):
        def quater(p):
            x, y = p
            if x >= 0 and y >= 0: return 2
            if x < 0 and y >= 0: return 1
            if x < 0 and y < 0: return 4
            if x >= 0 and y < 0: return 3

        def compare(p1, p2):
            if quater(p1) == quater(p2):
                t1 = p1[1]*p2[0] - p2[1]*p1[0]
                return  1 - 2*int((-p1[1], p1[0]) < (-p2[1], p2[0])) if t1 == 0 else 1 if t1 > 0 else -1
            else:
                return 1 if quater(p1) < quater(p2) else -1
        
        def cross(p1, p2, p3):
            return (p2[0]-p1[0])*(p3[1]-p1[1])-(p2[1]-p1[1])*(p3[0]-p1[0])

        start = min(points)
        points.pop(points.index(start))
        points = [[x - start[0], y - start[1]] for x, y in points]
        points.sort(key = cmp_to_key(compare))
        
        last = len(points) - 1
        while last > 0 and cross([0, 0], points[-1], points[last - 1]) == 0:
            last -= 1
            
        points[last:] = sorted(points[last:], key = lambda p: (-p[0]))

        ans = [[0, 0]]
        for p in points:
            ans.append(p)
            while len(ans) > 2 and cross(*ans[-3:]) < 0:
                ans.pop(-2)
        
        return [[x + start[0], y + start[1]] for x, y in ans]
