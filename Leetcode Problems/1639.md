title: Leetcode 1639. Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1639/
---

Let us denote by `dp[i][j]` number of solutions, such that the last symbol we take was from `i`-th column and also we create exactly `j` symbold of our `target`. Let also `sp[i][j]` be cumulative sum of `dp` on first index, that is `sp[i][j] = sp[i-1][j] + ... + sp[0][j]`.

Now, the question is how we an evaluate `dp[i][j]`. By definition, the last symbol we take is from `i`-th column. So, first, we need to understand how many options we have to take this symbol: for quick acces we use `Q[i][j]` array, how many times we have symbol `j` in `i`-th column. We need to multiply this number by `sp[i-1][j-1] = dp[0][j-1] + ... + dp[i-1][j-1]`, because previous taken symbol can be from any of previous columns. For example, it can happen, that `Q[i][ord(target[j]) - ord("a")] = 0`, it means that `dp[i][j] = 0` immedietly. Also we need to consider one more corner case: if `j = 0`, it means, we just start to build our `target` string, so in this case we do not need to multiply by `sp[i-1][j-1]`. Finally, we update our `sp` and do not forget to use modulo `N`.

**Complexity**: space complexity is `O(26n + nk)` to keep our `Q`, `dp` and `sp` tables. Time complexity is `O(nm + nk)` to form `Q` table and to update `dp` and `sp` tables.


```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, words, target):
        m, n, k, N = len(words), len(words[0]), len(target), 10**9 + 7
        Q  = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(n)]
        dp = [[0] * k for _ in range(n)]
        sp = [[0] * k for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                Q[i][ord(words[j][i]) - ord("a")] += 1

        dp[0][0] = sp[0][0] = Q[0][ord(target[0]) - ord("a")]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(k):
                if j > 0: dp[i][j] = Q[i][ord(target[j]) - ord("a")] * sp[i-1][j-1]
                else: dp[i][j] = Q[i][ord(target[j]) - ord("a")]
                sp[i][j] = (sp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j]) % N

        return sp[-1][-1] % N
