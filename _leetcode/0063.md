title: Leetcode 0063. Unique Paths II
tags: [dp, 2d-array]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/

#### Solution
This is a classical **dynamic programming** problem. Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of paths to reach coordinate `(i, j)`.  Then first of all we check if we can reach `(0, 0)` coordinate. Then for each cell we check two neighbours: one above and one to the left and add this number of ways to answer. In the end we return `dp[-1][-1]`

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)`, because we have `mn` states and two transactions from one to another. Space complexity is the same.


#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, M):
        m, n = len(M), len(M[0])
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        dp[0][0] = int(M[0][0] == 0)
        for i, j in product(range(m), range(n)):
            if M[i][j] == 1: continue
            if i > 0: dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]
            if j > 0: dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]
                
        return dp[-1][-1]
```
