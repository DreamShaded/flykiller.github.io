#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/orderly-queue/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/orderly-queue/

#### Solution
If `K > 1` than we can change any two adjacent elements: first we can rotate our string, such that we have `abX`, where `X` is some string. Then we can put `b` to the end and then `a` to the end, rotate again and we have `baX`. Now we can look at it as an bubble sort: doing these moves we can sort all string. If `K = 1` we allowed only rotate string and goal is to choose smallest one among `n` options.
 
#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space
 
#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def orderlyQueue(self, S, K):
        if K > 1: return "".join(sorted(S))
        return min(S[i:]+S[:i] for i in range(len(S)))
```
 
#### Remark
There is also `O(n)` Booth's Algorithm for finding of minimal rotation. Using count sort we can make whole algorithm `O(n)`. However given restrictions it is not needed.
