title: Leetcode 0413. Arithmetic Slices

Let us understand, what arithmetic slice means on the example 
`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 14, 16`.

First of all, we can take only adjacent elements, we can not take elements `[1, 3, 5]` for example.

Let us evaluate differences between adjacent elements.

`1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2`

We can say that arithmetic slice in original list are groups of `>=2` elements with equal values. So, what we can do is to iterate over groups of elements and calcualate answer for each group. Let us look at first one: we can take:

`1, 2, 3`, `2, 3, 4`, `3, 4, 5`, `1, 2, 3, 4`, `2, 3, 4, 5`, `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

In general case, if we have group of lenth `k` in list of differences, we have exaclty `k(k-1)/2` arithmetic slices. Note, that this also deal correctly with `k = 1` case, where we have arithmetic progression of length `2`, which is not slice.

However if you use groupby and will write `(len(list(j))-1)*len(list(j))//2 for ...`, it is not going to work properly, because groupby is iterator objext and it will take next `j`, which is not correct. We can use here the following trick: note, that

`k(k-1)/2 = ((2*k-1)^2 - 1)/ 8`, which uses only one yield from iterator groupby.

**Complexity**: time complexity is just `O(n)`, because we iterate list once to get differences and iterate it second time, evaluating sum. Space complexity is `O(n)`, because we create list `B` here. If you know how to still keep it oneliner but make it `O(1)` space, **please, let me know!**

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, A):
        B =  [j-i for i,j in zip(A, A[1:])]
        return sum(((2*len(list(j))-1)**2-1)//8 for i, j in groupby(B))
```

### Oneliner

It can be written as:

```
return sum(((2*len(list(j))-1)**2-1)//8 for i, j in groupby([j-i for i,j in zip(A, A[1:])]))
```
