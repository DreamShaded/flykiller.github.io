#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Steady-Speed/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Steady-Speed/

#### Solution
Evaluate absolute difference of adjacent elements, then use groupby.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, P):
        diff = [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(P, P[1:])]
        return max(len(list(j)) + 1 for i, j in groupby(diff))
```
