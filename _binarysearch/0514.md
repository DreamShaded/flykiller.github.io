#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Reverse-Sublists-to-Convert-to-Target/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Reverse-Sublists-to-Convert-to-Target/

#### Solution
All we need to check is that counters of two lists are the same.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n + m)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, target):
        return Counter(nums) == Counter(target)
```
