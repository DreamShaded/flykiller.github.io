#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/

#### Solution
As with a lot of other linked lists, it is good idea to add dummy node before list to avoid cases. Imagine, we have list `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`, let us add `0` node in the beginning, so we have `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6` now.

Now, let us look at the main step of algorithm (for simplicity I will call nodes by its values)
1. `pre = 0`, whe check if `pre.next` and `pre.next.next` exists, they are, so define `a = 1` and `b = 2`.
2. Now, we need to rewrite links: `0 -> 2`, `2 -> 1` and `1 -> 3`. Note, that we do it all in one step.
3. Finally, we say, that `pre = 1`. Also, our list now looks like `0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6` and as I said `pre = 1` now, so we swapped first two elements and now we on element number 2, which is exaclty what we have previously for smaller list.
4. On next step we have `0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6` and finally `0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5`, this is exaclty what we need to return.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`: we iterate over our list once, space complexity is `O(1)`: we did not add any new space and reused already existing nodes.

```
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head):
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        pre = dummy
        while pre.next and pre.next.next:
            a = pre.next
            b = a.next
            pre.next, b.next, a.next = b, a, b.next
            pre = a
        return dummy.next
```
