#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Compare/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Compare/

#### Solution
Just sort `b` and then use binary search. Or find number of elements, which are `< sorted(b)[-k]`

#### Complexity
It is `O(m log m + n)` for time and `O(m + n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, a, b, k):
        if not k: return len(a)
        target = sorted(b)[-k]
        return sum(x < target for x in a)
```
