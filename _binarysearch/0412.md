<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Interval-Intersection/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Interval-Intersection/

#### Solution
Find max of the left ends and min of the right ends.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, I):
        l = max(x for x, y in I)
        r = min(y for x, y in I)
        return [l, r]
```
