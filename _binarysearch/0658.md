#### Problem statement

#### Solution
The trick is the following: we need to look at all windows of size `n` in string `s + s`. Then if we replace every second symbol if this string with its flip, what we need to find is the biggest and smallest sums in windows of size `n`: smallest for alternating start with `0` and biggest for start with `1`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        ans = n
        R = list(s + s)
        R[1::2] = [1-int(x) for x in R[1::2]]
        R[::2] = [int(x) for x in R[::2]]
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(R))
        for i in range(n):
            t = acc[i + n] - acc[i]
            ans = min(ans, t, n - t)

        return ans
```
