#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Largest-K-Divisible-Subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Largest-K-Divisible-Subsequence/

#### Solution
Let us keep in `r` maximum possible sums of subsets such that they have reminders `0, 1, .., k-1`. In the beginning we need to define `r[0]` as `0` and all other elements as minus infinity. Then on each step we update `r`, adding `num`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n*k)` for time and `O(k)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        r = [0] + [-float("inf")]*(k - 1)
        for num in nums:
            r2 = [0]*k
            for i in range(k):
                r2[(i + num)%k] = r[i] + num
            r = [max(a, b) for a, b in zip(r, r2)]

        return r[0]
```
