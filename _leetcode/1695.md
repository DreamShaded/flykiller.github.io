#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-erasure-value/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-erasure-value/

#### Solution
In this problem we need to find subarray with biggest sum, which has only unique elements. This is in fact almost the same as problem **3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**, but here we need to find sum, not length. But idea is exaclty the same:

Let us keep window with elements `[beg: end)`, where first element is included and last one is not. For example `[0, 0)` is empty window, and `[2, 4)` is window with `2` elements: `2`-th and `3`-th.

Let us discuss our algorithm now:

1. `S` is set of symbols in our window, we use set to check in `O(1)` if new symbol inside it or not.
2. `beg = end = 0` in the beginning, so we start with empty window, also `ans = 0` and `n = len(nums)` and `sm = 0`: sum of elements in window.
3. Now, we continue, until one of two of our pointers reaches the end. First, we try to extend our window to the right: check `s[end]` in window and if we can, add it to set, move end pointer to the right and update `sm` and `ans`. If we can not add new symbol to set, it means it is already in window set, and we need to move `beg` pointer to the right, update `sm` and remove elements from `S`.

#### Complexity
We move both of our pointers only to the right, so time complexity is `O(n)`. Space complexity is potentially `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumUniqueSubarray(self, nums):
        beg, end, S, n, sm = 0, 0, set(), len(nums), 0
        ans = 0
        while end < n:
            if nums[end] not in S:
                sm += nums[end]
                S.add(nums[end])
                end += 1
                ans = max(ans, sm)
            else:
                sm -= nums[beg]
                S.remove(nums[beg])
                beg += 1
        
        return ans 
```

There is also oneliner solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumUniqueSubarray(self, a):
        return (f:=lambda l,r,s,c,b:b if r>=len(a) else f(l+1,r,s.remove(a[l]) or s,c-a[l],b) if a[r] in s else f(l,r+1,s.add(a[r]) or s,c+a[r], max(b,c+a[r])))(0,0,set(),0,0)
```
