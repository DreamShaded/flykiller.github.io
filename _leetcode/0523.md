tags: [math, hash table, accumulate]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/

#### Solution
Evaluate cumulative sums, and check if we have two of them with the same reminder of division by `k`.

#### Complexity
Space complexity is `O(k)`, time complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkSubarraySum(self, nums, k):
        d = defaultdict(list)
        for i, sm in enumerate([0] + list(accumulate(nums))):
            d[sm % k] += [i]
            
        for val in d:
            if d[val][-1] - d[val][0] >= 2: return True
        return False
```
