#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/

#### Solution
Iterate over string `s` with windows of length of string `p`, keep count of symbols, as well as number of frequencies which are correct. We can update all of this in `O(1)`, on each iteration adding one symbol to the end, and removing one symbol from the beginning. 

#### Complexity
Overall complexity is `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are sizes of strings `s` and `t`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s, p):
        dict_p, dict_s = Counter(p), defaultdict(int)
        num_to_correct, ans = len(dict_p), []
            
        for i in range(0, len(s)):  
            new_s = s[i]
            dict_s[new_s] += 1
            if dict_s[new_s] == dict_p[new_s]:
                num_to_correct -= 1
            if dict_s[new_s] == dict_p[new_s] + 1:
                num_to_correct += 1
                
            if i >= len(p):
                old_s = s[i - len(p)]
                dict_s[old_s] -= 1
                if dict_s[old_s] == dict_p[old_s] - 1:
                    num_to_correct += 1
                if dict_s[old_s] == dict_p[old_s]:
                    num_to_correct -= 1
                                
            if num_to_correct == 0: ans.append(i - len(p) +1)           
                    
        return ans
```

#### Remark
Very similar to problem **0567.** Permutation in String.
