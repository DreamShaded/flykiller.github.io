title: Leetcode 0408. Valid Word Abbreviation
tags: [string, parser, groupby]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-abbreviation/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-abbreviation/

#### Solution
Let us use `groupby` functionality to separate string into digits/letter.
1. First we check if lenght of reconstructed string is equal to original and if not, return false.
2. Then we check that no digits parts start with `0`.
3. Finally, we reconstruct string, where we put `*` to abbreviated symbols and compare string.

#### Complexity
It is $O(n + m)$, where $m$ and $n$ are lengths of original and abbreviated strings.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def validWordAbbreviation(self, word, abbr):
        t = [(i, "".join(j)) for i, j in groupby(abbr, key = lambda x:x.isdigit())]
        total_len = sum(int(j) for i,j in t if i) + sum(len(j) for i,j in t if not i)
	if total_len != len(word): return False
        if any(j[0] == "0" for i, j in t if i): return False
                
        cand = ""
        for i, j in t:
            if i: cand += int(j)*"*"
            else: cand += j
        
        return all(i==j or i=="*" for i, j in zip(cand, word))
```
