#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/add-bold-tag-in-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/add-bold-tag-in-string/

#### Solution
Let `n` be length of `s`, `m` is number of strings in dictionary and `l1, ... , lm` their lengths. Let us use binary list of length `n` with indication if we need to bold this symbol or not. 

First approach: for each word in dictionary and for every place check if we have found it. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n * (l1 + ... + lm))`, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def addBoldTag(self, s, d):
        n = len(s)
        arr, ans = [0]*n, ""
        for word in d:
            T = len(word)
            for i in range(n - T + 1):
                if s[i:i+T] == word:
                    arr[i:i+T] = [1]*T

        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 1 and (i == 0 or arr[i-1] == 0):
                ans += "<b>"
            ans += s[i]
            if arr[i] == 1 and (i == n-1 or arr[i+1] == 0):
                ans += "</b>"

        return ans
```

#### Remark
Another approach is to use KMP or Rabin-Karp to find in `O(n)` for each word its occurrences in `s`. Time complexity is `O(nm)`, space is `O(n)`.

Finally, we can use Tries: we create it from all words in dictionary and then for each letter in `s` try to find it in Trie, and if we found it, change some bits of our binary list to one. Space complexity is `O(n + (l1 + ... + lm))`, time complexity is `O(n * max(l1, ..., lm)`. This is the best theoretical complexity approach in majority cases.
