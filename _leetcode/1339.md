tags: [tree, dfs]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/

#### Solution
Let us understand: what split of binary tree means. If we have sum for one of splitted tree equal to `x`, then we know that sum of another tree will be `A - x`, where `A` is sum of all nodes. So, for each subtree we just need to find sum of nodes. We can do it using usual `dfs`.

1. If we reached None node, return `0`.
2. In the opposite case, we return sum of elements to the left + to the right + value of current node.
3. We add this sum to `res`: list in which we keep all sums of subtrees.
4. Finally, we return this sum, so we can use it later for recursion.
5. Then we find maximum value in `ans`: it will be sum of all nodes, because we have only positive ones and find maximum among `x*(A-x)`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, root):
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return 0
            ans = dfs(node.left) + dfs(node.right) + node.val
            res.append(ans)
            return ans
        
        res = []
        dfs(root)
        sum_all = max(res)
        return max(i*(sum_all-i) for i in res) % (10**9 + 7)
```
