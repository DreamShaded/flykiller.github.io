#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-all-possible-routes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-all-possible-routes/

#### Solution
Let `dp(last, F)` be number of ways to go from start to `last` location such that we have `F` fuel when we arrived. Then we can check all possible `dp(finish, 0), ..., dp(finish, fuel - 1)` and choose the best one.

#### Complexity
Time complexity `O(n^2*fuel)`, space complexity is `O(n*fuel)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countRoutes(self, L, start, finish, fuel):
        n, M = len(L), 10**9 + 7
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(last, F):
            if F > fuel: return 0
            if fuel == F: return last == start
            return sum(dp(i, F + abs(L[i] - L[last])) for i in range(n) if i != last) % M
          
        return (sum(dp(finish, i) for i in range(fuel)) + (start == finish)) % M
```

#### Remark
There is also in fact `O(n*fuel)` complexity solution, if we use the fact that we live on the line: let `rdp(j, f)` be number of ways to go from start to `j` with `f` fuel left, such that the last move was made to the left. Similarly, define `ldp(j, f)`. Then we can write the following equations:

`ldp(j, f) = rdp(j + 1, f - d(j, j+1)) + 2*ldp(j + 1, f - d(j, j+1))`
`rdp(j, f) = ldp(j - 1, f - d(j, j-1)) + 2*rdp(j - 1, f - d(j, j-1))`,

where `d(j, j+1)` is distance between cities `j` and `j + 1` (we need to sort them in advance). Also we need to deal with some border cases.
