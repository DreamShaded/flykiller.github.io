#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Left-Side-View-of-a-Tree/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Left-Side-View-of-a-Tree/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0199. Binary Tree Right Side View, just change left to right.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)` for classical dfs, space is `O(h)`, again classical complexity for dfs as well as this amount of space we need to keep in our answer.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, root):
        ans = {}
        def dfs(node, H):
            if not node: return 
            
            dfs(node.left, H + 1)
            if H not in ans: ans[H] = node.val
            dfs(node.right, H + 1)
            
        dfs(root, 0)
        return [ans[i] for i in range(len(ans))]
```
