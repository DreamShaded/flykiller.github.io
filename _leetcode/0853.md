#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/

#### Solution
First, we need to sort our cars by positions, starting from big ones and going to small ones. Let `lead` be time needed for the first car in fleet to reach destination. We iterate over cars and if we see that arriving time for car is more than `lead`, it means that this car will never gain leading car and we need to create new fleet. In opposite case, that is arriving time for care is less than `lead` we do nothing: leading car is still the same.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target, position, speed):
        cars = sorted(zip(position, speed), key = lambda x: -x[0])
        lead, ans = 0, 0
        
        for p, s in cars:
            if (target - p)/s > lead :
                lead = (target - p)/s
                ans += 1
                
        return ans
```
