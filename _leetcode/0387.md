#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/

#### Solution
We can not do better than `O(n)`, because we need to iterate over all string and count all frequencies. We can do it with `Counter(s)` in python. Then we iterate list once again and return the first symbol for which frequency is `1`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        count = Counter(s)

        for num, char in enumerate(s):
            if count[char] == 1: return num
        return -1
```
