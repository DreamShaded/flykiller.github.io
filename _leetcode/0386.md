#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographical-numbers/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographical-numbers/

#### Solution
We can solve it in `O(n)` time and space if we use backtracking: for each number `k`, we check than numbers `10k, ..., 10k + 9` less than `n`. When we met number more than `n`, we break. 

#### Complexity
So, for every number `1, ... , n` we check at most one number outside our range, and it makes `O(n)` complexity.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lexicalOrder(self, n):
        def dfs(num):     
            self.result.append(num)
            for i in range(1 if num == 0 else 0, 10):
                if num*10 + i > n: break
                dfs(num*10 + i)
                
        self.result = []
        dfs(0)
        return self.result[1:]
```

#### Remark
It can be seen as `trie` problem, but I am not sure that complexity will be `O(n)` in this case.
