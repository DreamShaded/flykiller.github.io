#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/

#### Solution
We can use the fact that all numbers are non-negative and use sliding window approach: we move `end` pointer if sum is less than `target` and `beg` if it is more than target.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        beg, end, sm, ans = 0, 0, 0, n + 1
        while beg < n:
            if sm < target and end < n:
                sm += nums[end]
                end += 1
            else:
                if sm >= target: ans = min(ans, end - beg)
                sm -= nums[beg]
                beg += 1
        
        return ans if ans != n + 1 else 0
```

#### Remark
If we want to have `O(n log n)` complexity, we can evaluate cumulative sums and then for every `Si` find minimum `Sj` such that `Sj - Si >= s, j > i` with help of binary search.
