#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sorting-Mail/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sorting-Mail/

#### Solution
We can use multisourse bfs here: put all starting values to the list first. Then on each step if we have next element, put it in the end of queue.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, mailboxes):
        locs = [(i, 0) for i in range(len(mailboxes))]
        ans = []
        for i, j in locs:
            if mailboxes[i][j] != "junk":
                ans += [mailboxes[i][j]]
            if j + 1 < len(mailboxes[i]):
                locs += [(i, j + 1)]
        return ans
```
