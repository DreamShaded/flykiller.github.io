#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/

#### Solution

This problem can be solved in a lot of diferent ways, here is just one of them: we will use that `3` is **prime** number, so if we take number `3^19`, then it is divisible by powers of `3` and by only them. Why we choose `3^19`? Because it is the biggest power of `3`, which fits in int32.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is just `O(1)` to check one division, because we precompute `3^19`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n):
        return 0 if n <= 0 else 1162261467 % n == 0
```
