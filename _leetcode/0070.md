### Solution 1:

We can climb either `1` or `2` steps, and we are interested how many ways to climb ladder with `n` stairs. How can we reach step number `n`:
1. Making step with size `1`, so from step with number `n-1`
2. Making step with size `2`, so from step with number `n-2`.

So, if we denote `F[n]` numbers of ways to reach step number `n`, we can write equation: `F[n] = F[n-1] + F[n-2]`. But it is not enough, we also need to define starting cases: `F[1] = 1` and `F[2] = 2`. Or we can say, that `F[0] = 1` and `F[1] = 1`.

Now, everything is ready to write our dynamic programming problem.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)` and space complexity is `O(1)`.



```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        dp = (1, 1)
        for i in range(n-1):
            dp = (dp[1], dp[0] + dp[1])
        return dp[1]
```

### Solution 2

If we look carefully at equation `F[n] = F[n-1] + F[n-2]` and starting points, we can see, that we have nothing else, than Fibonacci sequence:

`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`

Note however, that it is shifted by one position. So, what we need to do is to use Binet formula: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Binet's_formula, where we use computation by rounding.

**Complexity**: both time and memory is `O(1)` if we assume that number in `int32` range and if we assume complexity of `**` as `O(1)`.

```
return round((0.5+sqrt(5)/2)**(n+1)/sqrt(5))
```
