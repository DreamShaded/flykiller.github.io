#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/

#### Solution
The easiest way is to iterate over all possible times, count number of non-zero bits and return all possible candidates.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(H * M)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def readBinaryWatch(self, num):
        ans = []
        for h in range(12):
            for m in range(60):
                if (bin(h) + bin(m)).count("1") == num:
                    ans += [str(h) + ":" + "0"*(2 - len(str(m))) + str(m)]
        return ans
```

#### Remark
If we have more general case, then we can use backtracking: we need generate binary strings and then transform them to decimal, or do bit manipulations: `dfs(n, hours, mins, idx)`. Complexity is similar, but a bit smaller, something like $O(C_{10}^n)$.
