#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Kth-Permutation-Sequence/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Kth-Permutation-Sequence/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0060. Permutation Sequence, but indexes start with `0` here.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, k):
        numbers = list(range(1, n+1))
        answer = ""
        
        for n_it in range(n,0,-1):
            d = k//factorial(n_it-1)
            k -= d*factorial(n_it-1)
            answer += str(numbers[d])
            numbers.remove(numbers[d])
                   
        return answer
```
