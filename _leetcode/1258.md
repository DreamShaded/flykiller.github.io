#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/synonymous-sentences/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/synonymous-sentences/

#### Solution
We can separate algorithm in two parts:

1. Traverse graph and create connected components, we can do this for example with dfs.
2. For each word in `text`, check if we have it in components: if we do no have it, we have only one option, if we have it, we have all candidates from component. Then we use functionality of `product` to generate all answers.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of first part is `O(E + n)`, however time complexity of the second part can be exponential: it can be `O(m * 2^E)`, where `m` is length of `text` and `E <= 10`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def generateSentences(self, synonyms, text):
        G, V, idx = defaultdict(list), set(), 0
        comps, comps_inv = defaultdict(list), {}
        for x, y in synonyms:
            G[x].append(y)
            G[y].append(x)

        def dfs(node, idx):
            V.add(node)
            comps[idx] += [node]
            comps_inv[node] = idx
            for child in G[node]:
                if child not in V:
                    dfs(child, idx)

        for node in G.keys():
            if node not in V:
                dfs(node, idx)
                idx += 1
                
        cands = []
        for word in text.split():
            if word in comps_inv:
                cands += [sorted(comps[comps_inv[word]])]
            else:
                cands += [[word]]
                
        return [" ".join(x) for x in product(*cands)]
```
