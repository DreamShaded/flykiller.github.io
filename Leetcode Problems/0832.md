title: Leetcode 0832. Flipping an Image
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0832/
---

Let us do exactly what is asked in this problem: for each row: flip the image horizontally, then invert it. Quick way to get `0` from `1` and `1` from `0` is to use `1^q` (however tests are so small, so difference is not very big).

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(mn)`, where `m`, `n` are sizes of image. Space complexity is also `O(mn)` if we count output and `O(1)` space if we do not count. Note, that if we allowed to modify original image, than we can have `O(1)` space.

```
class Solution:
    def flipAndInvertImage(self, A):
        return [[1^q for q in row[::-1]] for row in A]
```
