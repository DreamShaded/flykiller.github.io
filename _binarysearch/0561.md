#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Hill-Maker/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Hill-Maker/

#### Solution
The idea is to look at this problem as shortest path problem in graph. We start from the right bottom corner and have states `(r, c, h)`, where `r` and `c` are coordinates and `h` is current height. For each node we check `4` neighbours and see what cost we need to pay to visit them.

#### Complexity
We have `O(mnH)` states, where `H` is number of different values in matrix. So, time complexity is `O(mnH*log(mnH))` for time and `O(mnH)` for space.

#### Code
```python
#### awice code
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        INF = float("inf")
        n, m = len(A), len(A[0])

        pq = [[0, n - 1, m - 1, A[-1][-1]]]
        dist = collections.defaultdict(lambda: INF)
        dist[n - 1, m - 1, A[-1][-1]] = 0
        while pq:
            d, r, c, h = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if dist[r, c, h] < d:
                continue
            if r + c == 0:
                return d
            for nr, nc in [[r + 1, c], [r, c + 1], [r - 1, c], [r, c - 1]]:
                if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m:
                    h2 = max(A[nr][nc], h)
                    d2 = d + max(h2 - A[nr][nc], 0)
                    if d2 < dist[nr, nc, h2]:
                        dist[nr, nc, h2] = d2
                        heapq.heappush(pq, [d2, nr, nc, h2])
```
