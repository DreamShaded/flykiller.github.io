tags: [math]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-number/

#### Solution
Just find all divisors in `O(sqrt{n})` and find their sum.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `(sqrt{n})`, space complexity is `O(1)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkPerfectNumber(self, num):
        sm = 0
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(num)) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                sm += (i + num//i)
            if i*i == num: sm -= i
                
        return num*2 == sm
```

#### Remark
Or we can use the fact that there is very small number of perfect numbers and check them all.
