#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/A-Number-and-Its-Triple/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/A-Number-and-Its-Triple/

#### Solution
Just use counter, be careful with `x = 0` case.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        cnt = Counter(nums)
        for x in nums:
            if (x != 0 and 3*x in cnt) or (x == 0 and cnt[x] >= 2): return True
        return False
```
