#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Palindrome-Count/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Palindrome-Count/

#### Solution
We can just use direct formula here. It is a bit strange, that it is not asked to find answer modulo `M`.

#### Complexity
it is `O(k)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, k):
        s = set(s)
        return len(s)**((k+1)//2)
```
