#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Delete-Repeated-Characters-with-Costs/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Delete-Repeated-Characters-with-Costs/

#### Solution
Use groupby to find groups of equal letter. Then choose the maximum corresponding value of `nums` and keep it. In the end calculate sum of all nums minus all we kept.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, nums):
        arr, ans = [], 0
        for x, y in groupby(s):
            arr += [len(list(y))]
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(arr))
        for x, y in zip(acc, acc[1:]):
            ans += max(nums[x:y])
        return sum(nums) - ans
```
