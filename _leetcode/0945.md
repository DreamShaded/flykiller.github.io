tags: [greedy, sort]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-increment-to-make-array-unique/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-increment-to-make-array-unique/

#### Solution
Sort our array and traverse it from start, each next element should be maximum among original one and previous, increased by one.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minIncrementForUnique(self, nums):
        nums = sorted(nums)
        nums2 = nums[:]
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(1, n):
            nums2[i] = max(nums2[i-1] + 1, nums[i])
            
        return sum(x - y for x, y in zip(nums2, nums))
```
