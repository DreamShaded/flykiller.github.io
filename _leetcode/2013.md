#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-squares/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-squares/

#### Solution
The idea is to keep two pieces of infromation:
1. `self.d` is counter for points, that is how many times we have each of them.
2. `self.x_coord` is defaultdict of counter for each coordinate `x`, that is given `x` we can quickly find all point with this coordinate.

What we need to do now:
1. for `add(self, point)` we just increment two counters.
2. for `count(self, point)` we need to find all points with the same coordinate `x`: points in the form `(x, y2)` and then reconstruct square: there will be two ways to do it: one above line and one below. Here we need to take into account frequences of our points, so we use `self.d` for this. Be careful to check that `y2 != y`, it costs me 5 minutes penalty on the contest.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of `add` is `O(1)`. Time complexity of `count` is potentially `O(n)` but in practice it is less because usually we do not have a lot of points on the same line. Space complexity of all data structure is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class DetectSquares:
    def __init__(self):
        self.d = Counter()
        self.x_coord = defaultdict(Counter)   # x -> all y coordinates with freqs

    def add(self, point):
        x, y = point
        self.d[x, y] += 1
        self.x_coord[x][y] += 1

    def count(self, point):
        x, y = point
        ans = 0
        for y2 in self.x_coord[x]:
            if y == y2: continue
            ans += self.d[x, y2] * self.d[x + y2 - y, y] * self.d[x + y2 - y, y2]
            ans += self.d[x, y2] * self.d[x + y - y2, y] * self.d[x + y - y2, y2]
        return ans
```
