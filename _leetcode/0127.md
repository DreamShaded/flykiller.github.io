In this problem we need to find shortest distance between two words, so the first idea you should think is classical bfs. 

1. Let `m` be length of each word and `n` be total number of words.
2. Let us also add `beginWord` to our list of words and create `words_inverse`: connections between words and their numbers.
3. Now, time to create `words_graph`. It can be done in the following way: iterate over each word and each place and find all possible neighbors for each word: for example for word `apple`, we have: `apple, bpple, cpple, ... zpple, aaple, abple,... azple, ..., appla, applb, ... applz`. In `words_graph` we will keep connections between indexes of words.
4. Run classical `bfs` for created graph, using deque: first, we mark all distances as `-1` and `0` for `endWord`. Then we extract left element fro queue, check if it is what we are looking for and if it is, we return distance. If it is not, then we visit all neighbors and if they are not visited yet, we add them to queue.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(26nm^2)`, because for each of `n` words we need to check all `26m` neighbours and each comparison of words is `O(m)`. Also we have `bfs` step, where we have graph on `m` nodes with at most `26n` neighbours for each node, so traverse of this graph will be `O(26mn)`, which is less than previous term. Space complexity is `O(26mn)`.

**Note**, that there is alternative way to create our graph: we can check each pair of words and we will have `O(mn^2)` time to create it. This method is preferable if `m*n*n < 26*n*m*m`, the is if `n < 26m`.

```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord, endWord, wordList):
        wordList.append(beginWord)
        m, n = len(wordList[0]), len(wordList)
        words_inverse = {w:i for i, w in enumerate(wordList)}
        
        words_graph = defaultdict(set)
        alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

        if endWord not in words_inverse: return 0
        end_ind = words_inverse[endWord]

        for word in wordList:
            for l in range(m):
                p1, p2 = word[0:l], word[l+1:]
                for i in alphabet:
                    tmp = p1 + i + p2
                    if tmp in words_inverse and tmp != word:
                        words_graph[words_inverse[word]].add(words_inverse[tmp])

        depths = [-1] * (n-1) + [0]
        queue = deque([n-1])

        while queue:
            curr = queue.popleft()
            if curr == end_ind:
                return depths[end_ind]  + 1
            for neib in words_graph[curr]:
                if depths[neib] == -1:
                    queue.append(neib)
                    depths[neib] = depths[curr] + 1
                    
        return 0
```
