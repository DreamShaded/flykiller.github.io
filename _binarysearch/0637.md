#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Concatenated-Sums/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Concatenated-Sums/

#### Solution
What we need to know is for each length how many numbers we have. Then we can have direct formula.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        return (sum(10**len(str(x)) for x in nums) + len(nums)) * sum(nums)
```
