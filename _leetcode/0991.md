Let us consider several cases and understand, what will be the best choise in each of them. Let us go in opposite direction and divide `Y` by `2` or add `1`, to it until we get `X`.

1. If `X > Y`, we do not have a lot of choice, we can just decrease `X` by one until it becomes equal to `Y`, so answer will be `X - Y`.
2. If `X == Y`, then we already happy and we return `0`.
3. If `Y % 2 == 1`, then let us think, what can be the last step? It can not be multilication by `2`, so the only choice is subtraction of `1` and on previous step we have configuration `(X, Y + 1)`, for which we run our function recursively.
4. If `Y % 2 == 0`, let us prove that we always need to divide by `2` in this case. 

Imagine, that we have sequence of operations, like: `[+1, +1, /2, /2, /2, +1, /2, ...]`. Then, if we have `+1, +1, /2` sequence inside, we can always replace it with `/2, +1`, so we can make it shorter. So, there will be no `+1, +1` subsequence, except for the very end and in general all sequence looks like: `[+1, /2, .., /2, +1, /2, ..., /2, ..., +1, ..., +1]`. Note, that the last part correspondes to case `1`. Also we will never have two `+1` in the middle and it means, that if we have even number, we **must** divide it by `2`: if we add `1` to it, then we have no choice to add `1` again (case 3) and then we have `+1, +1, /2` pattern.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(log Y)`, because every two iteration number decreased at least twice. Space complexity here is also `O(log Y)`, because we use recursion. It can be made `O(1)` if we do it iteratively.

```python
class Solution:
    def brokenCalc(self, X, Y):
        if X > Y: return X - Y
        if X == Y: return 0
        if Y % 2 == 0:
            return self.brokenCalc(X, Y//2) + 1
        else:
            return self.brokenCalc(X, Y + 1) + 1
```
