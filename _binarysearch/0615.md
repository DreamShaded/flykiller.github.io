#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Repeated-K-Length-Substrings/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Repeated-K-Length-Substrings/

#### Solution
Just check all substrings of length `k` and use counter.

#### Complexity
It is `O(nk)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, k):
        return sum(i != 1 for i in Counter(s[i:i+k] for i in range(len(s) - k + 1)).values())
```
