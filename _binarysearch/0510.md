#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Changing-Directions/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Changing-Directions/

#### Solution
We just need to find number of local minimums and maximums.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        n, ans = len(A), 0
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] or A[i-1] > A[i] < A[i+1]:
                ans += 1
        return ans
```
