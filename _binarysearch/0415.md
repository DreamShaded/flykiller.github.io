#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Anagram-Difference/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Anagram-Difference/

#### Solution
Problem constraints allow us to use bruteforce with backtracking. The idea is to find element in `a[x]` equal to `b[i]` and swap elements in `a`.

#### Complexity
I think it is between `O(2^n)` and `O(n!)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, a, b):
        def dfs(a, b, i):
            n = len(a)
            if i == n: return 0
            if a[i] == b[i]: return dfs(a, b, i + 1)

            ans = n
            for x in range(i, n):
                if a[x] == b[i]:
                    a[i], a[x] = a[x], a[i]
                    ans = min(ans, 1 + dfs(a, b, i + 1))
                    a[i], a[x] = a[x], a[i]
            return ans

        return dfs(list(a), list(b), 0)
```
