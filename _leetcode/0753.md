#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/cracking-the-safe/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/cracking-the-safe/

#### Solution 1
Our guess, that the length of final string will be `k^n + n - 1` and it will have `k^n` different substrings of length `n`. Actually, this is true and this string can be constructed and we can use `dfs` with backtracking to construct this string. Let us keep set of already checked passwords. In dfs, we use `build` string so far: so we add one more symbol in the end and check if last `n` elements in our set or not.

#### Complexity
It is difficult to estimate time complexity of this approach, but in practice it works only `2` times slower than the next one.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def crackSafe(self, n, k):
        self.cands_set = set(["0"*n])
        self.sol = ""

        def dfs(build):
            if self.sol != "": return
            if len(self.cands_set) == k**n:
                self.sol = build
                return
            for j in range(k):
                new = (build[-n+1:] if n > 1 else '') + str(j)
                if new not in self.cands_set:
                    self.cands_set.add(new)
                    dfs(build + str(j))
                    self.cands_set.remove(new)

        dfs("0"*n)
        return self.sol
```

#### Solution 2
Alternative way is to note, that we can look at this problem as graph, where we have `k^{n-1}` nodes and `k` connection from each node. For example for `n = 3` and `k = 2` we have the following graph: `00: [00, 01], 10: [00, 01], 01: [10, 11], 11: [10, 11]`. Then we need to find path, using all edges, that is Euler path.

#### Complexity
There will be `k^n` edges, but we need `O(n)` time to process one node. So finally, we have `O(k^n * n)` time and space complexity.


#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def crackSafe(self, n, k):
        if n == 1: return "0123456789"[:k]
        
        cands = ["".join(u) for u in product(map(str, range(k)), repeat = n-1)]
        targets = defaultdict(list)
        for a in cands:
            for b in range(k):
                targets[str(b)+a[:n-2]] += [a]

        route = []
        def dfs(node):
            while targets[node]:
                dfs(targets[node].pop())
            route.append(node)
    
        dfs("0"*(n-1))
        return route[0] + "".join(t[0] for t in route[1:])
```

#### Remark
Finally, there is `O(k^n)` solution, where we directly construct our string, but in my opinion it is too mathematical and no way you invent this in 1 hour.
