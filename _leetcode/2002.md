#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-subsequences/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-subsequences/

#### Solution
I saw several `dp` solution, which states that they have `O(2^n)` complexity, but they use bit manipulations, such as looking for first and last significant bit, which we can not say is truly `O(1)`. So I decided to write my own **true** `O(2^n)` solution.

Let `dp(mask)` be the maximum length of palindrome if we allowed to use only non-zero bits from `mask`. In fact, this means, if we have `s = leetcode` and `mask = 01011001`, we can use only `etce` subsequence. How to evaluate `dp(mask)`?

1. First option is we do not take last significant one, that is we work here with `01011000` and ask what is answer for this mask.
2. Second option is we do not take first significant bit, that is we work here with `00011001` mask here.
3. Final option is to take both first and last significant bits but it is allowed only if we have equal elements for them, that is we have mase `00011000` here and because `s[1] = s[7]` we can take this option.

Also what I calclate all first and last significant bits for all numbers in range `1, 1<<n`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(2^n)`, space complexity also `O(2^n)` to keep `dp` cache and `last` and `first` arrays.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        
        first, last = [0]*(1<<n), [0]*(1<<n)
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(1<<i, 1<<(i+1)):
                first[j] = i

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(1<<i, 1<<n, 1<<(i+1)):
                last[j] = i
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(m):
            if m & (m-1) == 0: return m != 0
            l, f = last[m], first[m]
            lb, fb = 1<<l, 1<<f
            return max(dp(m-lb), dp(m-fb), dp(m-lb-fb) + (s[l] == s[f]) * 2)
       
        ans = 0
        for m in range(1, 1<<n):
            ans = max(ans, dp(m)*dp((1<<n) - 1 - m))
            
        return ans
