#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Target-Number-with-Operations/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Target-Number-with-Operations/

#### Solution
We need to go from the end. Be careful with cases like `y = 10**10` and `x = 10**10//2 + 1`, then we can not divide by `2`, but we need to subtract `1` a lot, in this case we can return `steps + y - x`

#### Complexity
It is `O(log y)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, x, y):
        steps = 0
        while x != y:
            if y % 2 == 0:
                if y // 2 >= x:
                    y //= 2
                else:
                    return steps + (y - x)
            else:
                y -= 1
            steps += 1
        return steps
```
