#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-number-is-majority-element-in-a-sorted-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-number-is-majority-element-in-a-sorted-array/

#### Solution
Find the first and the last occurences of `target` and then calculate how many times we have it.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
from bisect import bisect, bisect_left

class Solution:
    def isMajorityElement(self, nums, target):
        l = bisect_left(nums, target)
        r = bisect(nums, target)
        return 2*(r - l) > len(nums)
```
