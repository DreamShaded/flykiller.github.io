title: Leetcode 1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1679/
---

The question which is asked: how many pairs can be constructed, such that sum in each pair is equal to `k`. Imagine, that `k = 8` and we have numbers `2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6`. Then we can construct `3` pairs in this case. In general if we have `c1` times of number `x` and `c2` times of number `k - x`, we can construct `min(c1, c2)` pairs with numbers `x, k - x`. So, all we need to do is to use `Counter(nums)` to calculate frequency of each number and then iterate over each number `val`, try to find number equal to `k  - val` and update `ans` by `min(freq, cnt[k - val])`. Note also, that when we do this, we count each pair exaclty `2` times, so we need to divide answer by `2` in the end.

**Question**: what happens, if `k = 8`, and we working wigh case `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4`? Then there can be constructed `7//2 = 3` pairs, but when we count we count it `7` times. However in the end we will divide it by `2` and everything will work fine: because there can be only one number like this: `k//2` (if k is odd or if there is no such pairs, everythin will be OK as well)

**Complexity**: time and space complexity is `O(n)`: we iterate over our number twice: when we build counter, and then when we iterate over counter.

**Oneliner** from Nyx314:
```
return (lambda c: sum(min(c[n], c[k-n]) for n in c))(Counter(nums))//2
```

```
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums, k):
        cnt, ans = Counter(nums), 0
        for val in cnt:
            ans += min(cnt[val], cnt[k - val])
        return ans//2
```
