#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/

#### Solution
This problem in fact can be quite difficult, if you did not solve it before. The trick is to use bit manipulations: on each iteration taking one bit from one number and put it to another.

#### Complexity
Complexity is `O(32)`, because we can have `32` iterations. In python however we need to deal with negative numbers, because they stored differently.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a, b):
        mask = 0xffffffff
        
        while b != 0:
            a, b = (a ^ b) & mask, ((a & b) << 1) & mask

        return ~(a ^ mask) if (a >> 31) & 1 else a
```
