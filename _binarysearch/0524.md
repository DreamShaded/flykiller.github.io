#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Chosen-N/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Chosen-N/

#### Solution
Use dp on subsets, where `dp(mask, i)` means that we already used columns from `mask` and currently on `i`-th row of matrix. Each time we check all bits which are equal to `1` in `mask` and if they are avaliable in `M`, we consider this candidate.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*2^n)`, because we have `O(2^n)` states (`i` is defined by `mask` uniquely) and `O(n)` transactions. Space complexity is `O(2^n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, M):
        n = len(M)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(mask, i):
            if i == -1: return 1
            ans = 0
            for j in range(n):
                if mask & (1<<j) and M[i][j] == 0:
                    ans += dp(mask ^ (1<<j), i - 1)
            return ans

        return dp((1<<n) - 1, n-1) % (10**9 + 7)
```
