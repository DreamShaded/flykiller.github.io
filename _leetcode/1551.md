#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal/

#### Solution
All we need to do in this problem is to use some school math. There will be two cases we need to consider, `odd` and `even` n. Let us consider `odd` case first:

1. **Odd** case: consider `1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17` to see the pattern. Then we need to make all numbers equal to `9`. How many operations we need? For pair `7,11` we need `2` operations, for `5,13` we need `4` operation, then `6` and `8`. In total we need `2+4+6+8 = 20` operations. How to calculate it in general case? If `n = 2k + 1`, then we need to calculate `2 + 4 + ... + 2k`, which is the sum of arithmetic progression and equal to `k*(k+1) = (n*n-1)//4`.
2. **Even** case: consider `1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15` to see the pattern. Then we need to make all numbers equal to `8`. We need `1 + 3+ 5 + 7 = 16` operations and in general case we need `1 + 3 + ... + 2k-1 = k*k = n*n//4` operations.
3. Finally we can write down it as one formula, using rounding.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is just `O(1)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, n):
        return n*n//4
```
