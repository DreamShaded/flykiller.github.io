#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/soup-servings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/soup-servings/

#### Solution
We can look at this problem as dp problem with state `a, b`: ml of soup of both types. Then if both qualities are zero, we return `0.5`, if  soup `A` is empty, we return `1` and if soup `B` is empty, we return `0`. Then we check `4` possibilities we have and return average of them. Also we can notice, that if `N` is big enough, then probability is very close to `1`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2)`, where `n = N/25` is possible range of our volumes of soup, space complexity as well. Note, that if `n > 500`, we return `1`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def soupServings(self, N):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(a, b):
            if a == 0 and b == 0: return 0.5
            if a == 0: return 1
            if b == 0: return 0 
            cand1 = dfs(max(a-100, 0), b)
            cand2 = dfs(max(a-75, 0), max(b-25, 0))
            cand3 = dfs(max(a-50, 0), max(b-50, 0))
            cand4 = dfs(max(a-25, 0), max(b-75, 0))
            return (cand1 + cand2 + cand3 + cand4)/4

        return dfs(N, N) if N < 7500 else 1
```
