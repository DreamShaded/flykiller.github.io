title: Leetcode 0873 Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence
tags: [dp, array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-fibonacci-subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-fibonacci-subsequence/

#### Solution
Let `dp(i, j)` be the longest subsequence such that last two elements are `i` and `j`. Then we check `j - i` and if it is in set of our numbers and it is smaller than `i`, we return `dp(j - i, i) + 1`. In the opposite case we return `2`. In the end we go through all pairs and find maximum.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2)`, space complexity as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lenLongestFibSubseq(self, arr):
        set_arr = set(arr)
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if j >= 2*i or j - i not in set_arr: return 2
            else: return dp(j - i, i) + 1
            
        ans = max(dp(i, j) for i, j in combinations(arr, 2))
        return ans if ans > 2 else 0
```
