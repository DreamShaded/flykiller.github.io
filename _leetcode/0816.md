#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/ambiguous-coordinates/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/ambiguous-coordinates/

#### Solution
Let us create function `generate(s)`, which generate all possible candidates for string `s`: we need to check number without dot and also all possible ways to put dot inside. We need to check the condition `our original representation never had extraneous zeroes`, so we check that if some number starts with `0`, it should be equal to `0`.

Then we split `S` into all possible  ways, for each part generate all numbers and then choose all pairs of numbers. 

#### Complexity
There is `O(n)` ways to split string `S` into two parts. Overall time and space complexity will be `O(n^4)`, for example for string `"(" + "1"*n + ")"`, number of ways will be approximately `n^3/6`, each of them have length `O(n)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def ambiguousCoordinates(self, S):
        def generate(s):
            ans = []
            if s == "0" or s[0] != "0": ans.append(s)
            for i in range(1, len(s)):
                if (s[:i] == "0" or s[0] != "0") and s[-1] != "0":
                    ans.append(s[:i] + "." + s[i:])
            return ans
        
        n, ans = len(S), []
        for i in range(2, n-1):
            cand_l, cand_r = generate(S[1:i]), generate(S[i:-1])     
            for l, r in product(cand_l, cand_r):
                ans.append("(" + l + ", " + r + ")")
                
        return ans
```
