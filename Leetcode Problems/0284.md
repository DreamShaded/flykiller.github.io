title: Leetcode 0284. Peeking Iterator

This is more design problem, not algorithmic one in my opinion. You already given implemented class `iterator`, which you can understand as list, but it is not list. The goal is to implement so-called peeking iterator and to do this we need to be one step ahead: let us create `self.buffer` variable, which will keep next value from our iterator.

1. When we call `peek` function, we just return value from our buffer.
2. When we call `next` function, we write buffer variable to `tmp`, then we update our buffer: if we have next element, we go to the next element, if we do not have it we make it equal to `None`.
3. Finally, `hasNext` function now is just checking if buffer is empty or not.

**Complexity**: it is `O(1)` for all operations, if it was `O(1)` for original `iterator` class.

```
class PeekingIterator:
    def __init__(self, iterator):
        self.iterator = iterator
        self.buffer = self.iterator.next() if self.iterator.hasNext() else None
        
    def peek(self):
        return self.buffer
        
    def next(self):
        tmp = self.buffer
        self.buffer = self.iterator.next() if self.iterator.hasNext() else None
        return tmp
        
    def hasNext(self):
        return self.buffer != None
```
