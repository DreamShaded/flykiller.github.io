#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/

#### Solution
Let us try to built our sequence element by element, inserting new element in different places. 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n! * n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums):
        def dfs(ind, built):
            if ind == len(nums):
                ans.append(built)
                return
            
            for i in range(ind+1):
                dfs(ind + 1, built[:i]+[nums[ind]]+built[i:])
                
        ans = []
        dfs(0, [])
        return ans
```
