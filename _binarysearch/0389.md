#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Outstanding-Move-Sequel/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Outstanding-Move-Sequel/

#### Solution 1 (text by awice)
Let `P[i]` be the prefix sum `sum(A[:i])`.
We can calculate that when we move an element `A[i] = x` over to some position `j`, it results in a change in power of `P[i] - P[j] - (i - j) * x`, which we can rewrite as `(-i * x + P[i])  -  (-j * x + P[j])`.

Now, let's say the j-th line is `eval_at(j, x) = -j * x + P[j]`. For each such `(i, x)`, lets try to calculate the minimum possible `eval_at(j, x)` over all lines `j`. We consider the lines in decreasing order of slope - that way, any time we have some lines intersect at `x_int = intersection(j1, j2)` [with `j1 < j2`], it means that `eval_at(j2, x)` will be a lower value when `x >= x_int`.

At the end, we have increasing `x` intersections hull, and the associated line indexes indexes. Now for each `x`, we find the corresponding line `indexes[...]` in our hull that will yield the lowest value of `eval_at(j, x)`.

For more information, google search "convex hull trick".

See also similar Leetcode Problem 0644 Maximum Average Subarray II, where one of the possible solutions uses the same trick.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        P = [0] + list(accumulate(A))
        base = sum(i * x for i, x in enumerate(A, 1))

        def eval_at(j, x):
            return -j * x + P[j]

        def intersection(j1, j2):
            return (P[j2] - P[j1]) / (j2 - j1)

        hull = [-1]
        indexes = [0]
        for j in range(1, len(P)):
            while hull and intersection(indexes[-1], j) <= hull[-1]:
                hull.pop()
                indexes.pop()

            hull.append(intersection(indexes[-1], j))
            indexes.append(j)

        ans = base
        for i, x in enumerate(A):
            j = bisect.bisect(hull, x)
            j = max(j - 1, 0)
            ans = max(ans, base + eval_at(i, x) - eval_at(indexes[j], x))
        return ans % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

#### Solution 2
Another solution is to use again `eval_at` function, but know we will use ternary search to fine the optimum of convex function. Notice that function 

$$f(x) = \max\limits_{i=1..n} \texttt{eval_at}(i, x)$$
is convex. Why the rest of the solution works, I am not sure, something about convex duality may be? Also it is possible that it is wrong.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        base = ans = sum(i * x for i, x in enumerate(A, 1))
        n = len(A)
        P = [0] + list(accumulate(A))
    
        def eval_at(j, x):
            return -j * x + P[j]

        for i, x in enumerate(A):
            l, r = 0, n
            while r - l >= 4:
                m1, m2 = l+(r-l)//3, r-(r-l)//3
                if eval_at(m1, x) < eval_at(m2, x):
                    r = m2
                else:
                    l = m1

            for j in range(l, r+1):
                ans = max(ans, base + eval_at(i, x) - eval_at(j, x))

        return ans % (10**9 + 7)
