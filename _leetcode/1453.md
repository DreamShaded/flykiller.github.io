#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-darts-inside-of-a-circular-dartboard/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-darts-inside-of-a-circular-dartboard/

#### Solution
There is `O(n^4)` solution, where for each `3` points we construct circumcenter and then check how many point will be in circle with this center and radius `r`. There is also `O(n^3)` solution, where we consider only `O(n^2)` points which are intersections of circles with centers in given points and radii `r`. Why it is enough? Because each circular dartboard can be shifted such that it has at least `2` points on its border.

Finally, there is `O(n^2 log n)` angular sweep solution. For each point `A` we want to consider circles with radius `r`, which pass through `A`. We can look at center of this circle and consider at most `2n-2` points, where this circle go through one of the other points (it can be less than `2n-2` if points are far). Then we sort these points in polar coordinates and then we traverse all these points and add `+1` when we start some circle and add `-1` when we finish it. So at each moment of time we keep number of `active` points. It is quite difficult to understand without images (because this is geometry). 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2 log n)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def DistSquare(self, Ax, Ay, Bx, By):
        return (Ax - Bx)*(Ax - Bx) + (Ay - By) * (Ay - By)
    
    def numPoints(self, points, r):
        N, P, MaxPoint = len(points), points, 1
        
        for x0, y0 in points:           
            list_sweep = []
            for x1, y1 in points:
                temp_dist = self.DistSquare(x0, y0, x1, y1)
                if temp_dist <= 4*r*r and temp_dist > 0.001:
                    alpha = atan2(y1 - y0, x1 - x0)
                    beta = acos(sqrt(temp_dist)/2/r)
                    list_sweep.append([alpha - beta, -1])
                    list_sweep.append([alpha + beta, 1])
            
            if list_sweep:
                list_sweep.sort()
                MaxPoint = max(MaxPoint, -min(accumulate([i[1] for i in list_sweep])) + 1)
                    
        return MaxPoint
```
