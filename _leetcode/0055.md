#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/

#### Solution
Similar to problem **0045** Jump Game II, but here we need to check if we can reach the end. As in problem 0045 we can create cumulative maximum of `i + nums[i]` and check if for some element we have `i == t[i]`: if we have such place, we stuck and we can not reach the last cell, if not, we can reach.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums):
        t = list(accumulate([i + num for i, num in enumerate(nums)], max))
        return all(i != t[i] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
```
