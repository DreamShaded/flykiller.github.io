#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Substring-with-Character-Count-of-at-Least-K/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Substring-with-Character-Count-of-at-Least-K/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters, but we need to use more efficient algorithm. If we have all frequencies more than `k`, we can take all string. If not, we can split string into parts and use recursion.

#### Complexity
It is still `O(26n)`, but it works quite fast.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, k):
        for c in set(s):
            if s.count(c) < k:
                return max(self.solve(t, k) for t in s.split(c))
        return len(s)
```
