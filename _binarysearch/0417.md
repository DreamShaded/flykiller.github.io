#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Common-Prefix/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Common-Prefix/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0014. Longest Common Prefix.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(S)`, where `S` is sum of lengths of all strings, space complexity is `O(m)`, where `m` is maximal length of string.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, strs):
        if not strs: return ""
        for i in range(len(strs[0]) + 1):
            if not all(i < len(word) and word[i] == strs[0][i] for word in strs):
                break
                
        return strs[0][:i]
```
