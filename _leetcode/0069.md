#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/

#### Solution
We can just start from 1 and increase it. Or we can do binary search.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of binary serach is `O(log n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x):
        if x == 0: return 0
        
        beg, end = 1, x
        while end - beg > 1:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if mid*mid > x:
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid
                
        return beg
```
