tags: [string, groupby]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/

#### Solution
It is easier to understand solution on some example, imagine we have `00001101111000`. Then we need to look at groups of `0` and `1` which are located side by side. For example first groups we haver are `0000` and `11`. It means, that we can have either `01` or `0011` as good substrings. Then we have `11` and `0`, here we can take only `10`. Then we have `01111`, we can take `01` and finally we have `1111000` and we can take `10`, `1100`, `111000`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is also potentially `O(n)`, because we use `len(list(j))`, if you know how to avoid this, still using groupby, please let me know.

#### Code

```
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s):
        t = [len(list(j)) for i, j in groupby(s)]
        return sum([min(t[i],t[i+1]) for i in range(len(t)-1)])
```
