title: Leetcode 0796 Rotate String
tags: [string, kmp, rolling hash]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string/

#### Solution
We just need to check that lengths of both strings are the same and `B in A+A`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity in python will be in average `O(n)`, space is also `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def rotateString(self, A, B):
        return len(A) == len(B) and B in A+A
```

#### Remark
Other algorithms are bruteforce with `O(n^2)/O(1)` time/space, KMP and Rolling hash with `O(n)/O(n)` time/space
