title: Leetcode 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60
tags: []
---

If you are familiar with modular arithmetic, this problem will be very easy for you. So, we need to find number of pairs of songs, such that total duration in each pair is divisible by `60`: there can be several cases how it is possible. Imagine we have `2` songs `a` and `b`, then:
[1]. `a` and `b` have reminders `0`.
[2]. `a` has reminder `1` and `b` has reminder `59`.
[3]. `a` has reminder `2` and `b` has reminder `58`.

[59]. `a` has reminder `58` and `b` has reminder `2`.
[60] `a` has reminder `59` and `b` has reminder `1`.

So, what we need to do now: for each reminder calculate how many number we have with this reminder and then evaluate sum of products: `a1*a59 + a2*a58 + ...`, where `a1` is number of numbers with reminder `1` and so on. Also we need to be careful with reminders `0` and `30`: for them we need to choose number of combinations.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(60) = O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time):
        d, T = Counter(), 60
        for t in time: d[t%T] += 1
        ans = sum(d.get(i,0)*d.get(T-i,0) for i in range(1, T//2))
        q1, q2 = d.get(0,0), d.get(T//2, 0)
        return ans + q1*(q1-1)//2 + q2*(q2-1)//2
```
