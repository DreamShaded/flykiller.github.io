#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-subsequences-gcds/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-subsequences-gcds/
#### Solution

#### Solution 1

I really hate what it happens that on other languages solution will pass, but not on python.

The idea is the following:

1. For each `num` in `nums` evaluate the list of divisors. Unfortunatelly it is not enough to do it in stupid way, python will not allow this, so I used the idea if we already calculated list of divisors, no need to do it again.

2. Create defaultdict `d`, where for each `i` we correspond it to the list of `num` from nums, which are divisible by `i`.

3. Iterate over `d` and for each `i` check if gcd of all numbers in `d[i]` is equal to `i`. If it is the case, then number `i` is gcd of some group of numbers.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is potentially `O(n^1.5)`, because we iterate to the `n^0.5` when we find divisors. However with more detailed analysis it is more like `O(m log m)`, check solution 2. 
Space complexity is the same.

#### Code

I think I was lucky that it finally was accepted on contest, now it will give me 9500+ and sometimes TLE

```python
class Solution:
    def countDifferentSubsequenceGCDs(self, nums):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def divisors(n):
            for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
                if n%i == 0:
                    s = divisors(n//i)
                    return tuple(set(s + tuple(q*i for q in s)))

            return tuple([1, n])
        
        nums = set(nums)
        q = defaultdict(list)
        for num in nums:
            for div in divisors(num):
                q[div].append(num)
                
        ans = 0
        for num in q:
            list_div = q[num]
            s = list_div[0]
            for i in range(1, len(list_div)):
                s = gcd(s, list_div[i])
                if s == num:
                    break

            if s== num: ans += 1
        
        return ans
```

#### Solution 2:

The following solution has very similar idea, but smart way to evaluate all divisors. Idea behind is exaclty the same as previously: for each `i` we check all numbers divisible by `i` and find if `gcd` of all those numbers equal to `i`.

#### Complexity:

Let `m` be the biggest number in `nums`, then there will be no more than `m + m/2 + m/3 + ... = O(m log m)` divisors in total. So, time complexity can be expressed as `O(m*log m)`. Notice also that it is under assumption that `gcd` can be evaluated in `O(1)`, which is not exactly the case, it is more like `log m`, so we need to multiply it by `log m` factor. Space complexity is the same.

```python
class Solution:
    def countDifferentSubsequenceGCDs(self, nums):
        T = max(nums) + 1
        nums = set(nums)
        ans = 0
            
        for x in range(1, T):
            g = 0
            for y in range(x, T, x):
                if y in nums:
                    g = gcd(g, y)
                if g == x:
                    break
                    
            if g == x: ans += 1
                
        return ans
```

It also can be written in very short form:
```python
T, nums, ans = max(nums) + 1, set(nums), 0
return sum(gcd(*[y for y in range(x, T, x) if y in nums]) == x for x in range(1, T))
```
