#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/4-keys-keyboard/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/4-keys-keyboard/

#### Solution
Let `dp[i]` be the maximum number of `A` we can have, `i` operations. Then the last operation can be key 1: then we have `dp[i-1] + 1` letters `A`; or we can apply key 2, key 3 + several times key 4, then we can have `dp[i-k]*(k-1)` letters `A`, because we can increase number of letters in `k-1` times, using `k` operations. Complexity will be `O(n^2)`. It can be optimized and shown that `k` is always equal to `4` or `5`, so complexity can be reduced to `O(n)` as in the following code. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(n)`, which can be reduced to `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxA(self, N):
        dp = [0] * (N+1)
        dp[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, N+1):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + 1, dp[i])
            for k in range(4, min(6,i-1)):
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-k]*(k-1))
        
        return dp[-1]
```
