title: Leetcode 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1026/
---

Let us traverse our tree from top to bottom with `dfs` function, where we pass parameters:

1. `node` is current node we visiting
2. `high` is maximum over all node values, which are above our `node`, that is the maximum among parent, parent of parent, parent of parent of parent and so on.
3. `low` is minumum over all node values, which are above our `node`.

No, we iterate over our tree and:
1. Update our `self.Max`: look at two values `abs(node.val - low)` and `abs(node.val - high)`: it will be the biggest candidates for difference between node and its ancestor, where `node` is **lying in lower layer**.
2. Now, we run our `dfs` for left and right children, where we updated `low` and `high` values: we need to include current `node.val`.

We start with `dfs(root, root.val, root.val)`, because we do not have nodes which are above our root.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`, as any usual dfs have.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAncestorDiff(self, root):
        
        self.Max = 0
        def dfs(node, low, high):    
            if not node: return

            self.Max = max(self.Max, abs(node.val-low), abs(node.val-high))
            low1, high1 = min(low, node.val), max(high, node.val)
            dfs(node.left, low1, high1)
            dfs(node.right, low1, high1)
                
        dfs(root, root.val, root.val)
        return self.Max
```
