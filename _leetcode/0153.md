title: Leetcode 0153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
tags: [array, binary search]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

#### Solution
In fact this problem is very similar to problem **0033**, but here we need to find not target element, but minimum. We can use exactly the same logic:

1. `if nums[end] < nums[mid]`, this means that minimum we are looking for is situated in the right half.
2. `elif nums[end] > nums[mid]` means that minimum we are looking for is situated in the left half.
3. `if end - start <=  1` means that we have interval of length `1` or `2`, so we can directly check minimum.

Also here I did it in recursive, not iterative way just for the purpose of exercise.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:    
    def findMin(self, nums):
        def dfs(start, end):
            if end - start <=  1:
                return min(nums[start], nums[end])

            mid = (start + end)//2
            if nums[end] < nums[mid]:
                return dfs(mid + 1, end)
            elif nums[end] > nums[mid]:
                return dfs(start, mid)

        return dfs(0, len(nums) - 1)
```
