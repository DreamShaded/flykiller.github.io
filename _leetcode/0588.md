#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-in-memory-file-system/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/design-in-memory-file-system/

#### Solution
Quite painful problem from technical point of view, because you need to code about 30-40 lines. The idea is to have Tree like structure, where we have two fields: `dirs` and `files`, where `dirs` is dictionary which have again different Nodes. In fact what we nave is almost classical `Trie`, where `files` is end nodes and `dirs` are another nodes.

1. Funciton `getExistedNode(self, path)` returns Node, and its type, given `path`.
2. Function `ls(self, path)`: first we need to find this path in our tree structure, then check if it is directory or file and return either list of all directories and files or just name of file.
3. Function `mkdir(self, path)`: we start from root of our Tree structure and then create new subfolder if needed and go one level deeper.
4. Function `addContentToFile(self, filePath, content)`: first we need to parse our `filePath` and create directory, using `mkdir`. Then we go to desired node and either create empty file or add content to existing file.
5. Function `readContentFromFile(self, filePath)`: very similar to previous function, but we need just to return content of file.

#### Complexity
Time complexity: it is `O(n)` for `mkdir, getExistedNode`, where `n` is length of path. For `ls` it is `O(n + k log k s)`, where `k` is number of files and dirs in answer and `s` is average length of its names. For `addContentToFile` and `readContentFromFile` it is `O(n + m)`, where `m` is size of content/file. Also we have `O(n + T)` space complexity, where `T` is size of all our File System.

#### Code
```python
#### borrowed code
class FileSystem(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = {'dirs' : {}, 'files': {}}

    def ls(self, path):
        node, tpe = self.getExistedNode(path)
        if tpe == 'dir': return sorted(list(node['dirs'].keys()) + list(node['files'].keys()))
        return [path.split('/')[-1]]

    def mkdir(self, path):
        node = self.root
        for dr in filter(len, path.split('/')):
            if dr not in node['dirs']: node['dirs'][dr] = {'dirs' : {}, 'files': {}}
            node = node['dirs'][dr]

    def addContentToFile(self, filePath, content):
        dirs = filePath.split('/')
        path, file = '/'.join(dirs[:-1]), dirs[-1]
        self.mkdir(path)
        node, tpe = self.getExistedNode(path)
        if file not in node['files']: node['files'][file] = ''
        node['files'][file] += content

    def readContentFromFile(self, filePath):
        dirs = filePath.split('/')
        path, file = '/'.join(dirs[:-1]), dirs[-1]
        node, tpe = self.getExistedNode(path)
        return node['files'][file]
        
    def getExistedNode(self, path):
        node = self.root
        for dr in filter(len, path.split('/')):
            if dr in node['dirs']: node = node['dirs'][dr]
            else: return node, 'file'
        return node, 'dir'
```
