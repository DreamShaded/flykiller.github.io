title: Leetcode 1618 Maximum Font to Fit a Sentence in a Screen
tags: [string, binary search, interactive]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-font-to-fit-a-sentence-in-a-screen/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-font-to-fit-a-sentence-in-a-screen/

#### Solution
The idea is just to use simple binary search. Here I added two border cases to `fonts`: zero and infinite, actually `fontInfo` will neve be taken with this values, because they are on the border.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(N*log M)`, where `N` is size of text and `M` is size of `fonts`. Space comlexity is `O(M)`, because I used dummy variables. Space can be done in `O(1)` as well, if we rewrite binary steps a bit.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxFont(self, text, w, h, fonts, fontInfo):
        fonts = [0] + fonts + [float("inf")]
        beg, end = 0, len(fonts) - 1
        
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            total_w = sum(fontInfo.getWidth(fonts[mid], c) for c in text)
            total_h = fontInfo.getHeight(fonts[mid])
            if total_w <= w and total_h <= h:
                beg = mid
            else:
                end = mid
                
        return fonts[beg] if beg > 0 else -1
```
