#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/push-dominoes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/push-dominoes/

#### Solution
Let us iterate through our string and keep two pointers: for positions where values not equal to `.` and the go one after another. Pointers `prev, i` can point to symbols `L` or `R` and we can have `4` different options:

1. `L...L`, in this case, we need to fill everything with `L`
2. `R...R`, in this case, we need to fill everything with `R`
3. `L...R`, we need to keep it as it is
4. `R...L`, then we need to fill first half with `R` and second with `L`, handling odd and even cases.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def pushDominoes(self, D):
        D = "L" + D + "R"
        n, prev, ans = len(D), 0, ""
        for i in range(1, n):
            diff = i - prev - 1
            if D[i] == ".": continue
            
            if D[i] == D[prev]:
                ans += D[i]*diff     
            elif D[i] == "L" and D[prev] == "R":
                m, d = divmod(diff, 2)
                ans += "R"*m + "."*d + "L"*m
            else:
                ans += "."*diff
                
            ans += D[i]
            prev = i
        
        return ans[:-1]
```
