#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/move-sub-tree-of-n-ary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/move-sub-tree-of-n-ary-tree/

#### Solution
Not very interesting problem, where we need to carefully check all possible cases and handle them. Let `dfs(node, target)` be function which traverse subtree of `node` and look for `target` node in this subtree: it return the parent of node `target`. (not mine code, I think it is better tu use dfs with parent variable)

Evaluate `q_parent = dfs(p, q)` and `p_parent = dfs(root, p)`. Then we can have different options:

1. If `q_parent != None` and `p_parent != None`, it means, that `q` is children of `p` and `p` is not equal to root (Example 4 in problem description). We need to remove `q` from children of `q_parent` and append `p` to children of `q`. Then we reattach subtree `q` to the place we deleted it from.
2. If `q_parent = None` and `p_parent == None`, it means that `q` is children of `p` and `p` is root of our tree (Example 5 in problem descripton). We need to remove `q` from children of `q_parent` and append `p` to children of `q`. We do not need to do the second part like in previous case, but change root to `q`.
3. If `q_parent == None` and `p_parent != q`, it means that `q` is not chilren of `p` and than `p` is not direct child of `q` (Examples 1 and 3 in problem description). In this case we just remove `p` from childrens of `p_parent` and add `p` to childrens of `q`. Note that in example 1 node `p` is in subtree of `q` and in example 3 they have LSA `root`, but in fact these two examples are quite the same.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time, where `n` is size of tree and `O(h)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def moveSubTree(self, root, p, q):
        def dfs(node, target):
            if not node: return node
            for child in node.children:
                if child == target: return node
                p = dfs(child, target)        
                if p: return p
            return None

        q_parent = dfs(p, q)
        p_parent = dfs(root, p)

        if q_parent:
            q_parent.children.remove(q)
            q.children.append(p)
            if p_parent:
                j = p_parent.children.index(p)
                p_parent.children[j] = q
            else:
                root = q
        elif p_parent != q:
            p_parent.children.remove(p)
            q.children.append(p)

        return root
```
