In this problem you just need to do what is asked: if we have even and odd indexes, generate data in correct way. There is a couple of small tricks to make your code cleaner:
1. Create `nums = [0] * (n + 2)` to handle case `n = 0`.
2. Use ` nums[i] = nums[i//2] + nums[(i//2)+1] * (i%2)` to handle both cases of even and odd indexes
3. Finally, return maximum among first `n + 1` elements.

**Complexity**: time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

**Discussion** As it is with given solution problem just do not have any idea behind. I think there should be `O(log n)` solution, I am thinking about right now.

```python
class Solution:
    def getMaximumGenerated(self, n):
        nums = [0]*(n+2)
        nums[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            nums[i] = nums[i//2] + nums[(i//2)+1] * (i%2)
    
        return max(nums[:n+1])
```
