#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/

#### Solution
Let us use coordinate `(x, y)` and direction of movement `(dx, dy)`. Each time when we reach point outside matrix we rotate. How we can rotate? We can either create array of rotations in advance or we can use the trick `dx, dy = -dy, dx`. Also how we understand it is time to rotate? We will write already visited elements with `*`, so when we see `*` or we go outside the grid, it is time to rotate.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` both for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def spiralOrder(self, matrix):
        n, m = len(matrix[0]), len(matrix)
        x, y, dx, dy = 0, 0, 1, 0
        ans = []
        for _ in range(m*n):
            if not 0 <= x+dx < n or not 0 <= y+dy < m or matrix[y+dy][x+dx] == "*":
                dx, dy = -dy, dx
                
            ans.append(matrix[y][x])
            matrix[y][x] = "*"
            x, y = x + dx, y + dy
        
        return ans
```
