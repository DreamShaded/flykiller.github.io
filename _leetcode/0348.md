#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tic-tac-toe/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tic-tac-toe/

#### Solution
Let us keep `board` as well as scores for each row, column and two diagonals. By score I mean we will add $1$ for the first player and $n+1$ for the second. Then if we get score $n$, it means, that first player wins, if we get score $n(n+1)$, it means the second wins and if we have something else, no one wins.

#### Complexity
It is $O(n^2)$ for initialization and just $O(1)$ to make move.

#### Code
```python
class TicTacToe:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.board = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        self.rows = [0]*n
        self.cols = [0]*n
        self.d1, self.d2 = 0, 0
        self.n = n

    def move(self, row, col, player):
        self.board[row][col] = player
        addon = 1 if player == 1 else self.n + 1
        self.rows[row] += addon
        self.cols[col] += addon
        if col == row: self.d1 += addon
        if col + row == self.n - 1: self.d2 += addon
            
        if self.n*addon in [self.rows[row], self.cols[col], self.d1, self.d2]:
            return player
        
        return 0
```
