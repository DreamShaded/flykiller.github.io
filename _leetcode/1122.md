title: Leetcode 1122. Relative Sort Array
tags: [sort, hash table]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-sort-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-sort-array/

#### Solution
Create dictionary, where for each value in `B` we keep its index. Then when we sort we use `get` function, which will return value if it is in dictionary and shifted by big value.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space, where `n = len(A)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def relativeSortArray(self, A, B):
        k = {b: i for i, b in enumerate(B)}
        return sorted(A, key=lambda a: k.get(a, 10**9 + a))
```
