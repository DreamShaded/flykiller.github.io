#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Collatz-Sequence/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Collatz-Sequence/

#### Solution
We just need to simulate the process.

#### Complexity
Hopefully it is not big, `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of sequence, but how long it is, is a good question.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        ans = 0
        while n != 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                n = n//2
            else:
                n = 3*n + 1
            ans += 1
        return ans + 1
```
