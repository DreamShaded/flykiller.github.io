title: Leetcode 0935. Knight Dialer
tags: [dp, matrix power]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-dialer/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-dialer/

#### Solution
We can use dp with 10 states, where `dp[step][i]` is number of ways to finish at cell `i`. Notice that in fact we only need to keep one row at at time. 

#### Complexity
It is `O(n * m)`, where `m = 20` here is number of possible moves of knight.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def knightDialer(self, n):
        d = {0:(4,6), 1:(6,8), 2:(7,9), 3:(4,8), 4:(3,9,0), 5:(), 6:(1,7,0), 7:(2,6), 8:(1,3), 9:(2,4)}
        M = 10**9 + 7
        dp = [1]*10
        for i in range(n-1):
            dp2 = [0]*10
            for i in range(10):
                for prev in d[i]:
                    dp2[i] += dp[prev]
            dp = [i%M for i in dp2]
            
        return sum(dp) % M
```

#### Remark
There is also matrix power solution with complexity `O(10^3 * log n)`.
