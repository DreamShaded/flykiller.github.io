#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/

#### Solution
We can sort pairs: (frequency, letter) using counter for all string.

#### Complexity
Time complexity in `O(n + m log m)`, where `m` is size of alphabet, space complexity is `O(m)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s):
        return "".join([a*b for a,b in Counter(s).most_common()])
```

#### Remark
Other approaches:

We can use counters to count frequencies of each element and put them into hash table. Then we can use the fact, that frequencies are never more than `n` and use buckets: for example if some letter have frequency `3`, put it to bucket number `3`. Then we traverse buckets from the end and build string. Overall time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

We can also use heaps instead of sort with exaclty the same complexity. In practice, if `m` is not big, performance can be better than buckets approach.
