#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-ii/

#### Solution
Actually, what is asked is to find the window of maximum length, such that it has at most one `0`. One way is to use sliding window approach, where we move right side if number of `0` is not more than `1` and if it is, move left side until it becomes `>= 1`. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, A):
        ans, n, zeroes = 0, len(A), 0
        beg, end = 0, 0
        while end < n:
            if end < n and zeroes + (A[end] == 0) <= 1:
                zeroes += (A[end] == 0)
                end += 1
                ans = max(ans, end - beg)
            else:
                zeroes -= (A[beg] == 0)
                beg += 1

        return ans
```

#### Remark
There is also dp approach, where `dp[i][j]` is the length of longest subarray of with `j` zeros, such that it ends at point `i` with `O(n)` time complexity and `O(n)` or `O(1)` space complexity. See also almost the same Problem **1493** Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element.
