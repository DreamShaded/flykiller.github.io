In this problem we need to find the shortest path in graph, so the first thing you should think about is **bfs** or breadth first search. We will keep tuples with `3` elements: `(distance, coordinate x, coordinate y)`. On each step we extract element from the left side of our `queue`, check if coordinates equal to ending point and if they are, we return distance. If not, for all `8` neighbours, we check if we can visite them: if we still inside grid, if value of grid is equal to `0` and if it was not visited previously. We add new node to `visited` set and to the end of our queue. (Note, that there is alternative way, where we directly change our grid without using visited set)

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(N^2)`: number of nodes in our graph. If we use visited set, space complexity is also `O(N^2)`. If not, it is just `O(N)`, because during traversal there will always be only nodes with distances `x` and `x+1` any given moment and there can be `O(N)` nodes with every distance.

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestPathBinaryMatrix(self, grid):
        N = len(grid)
        neibs = [[-1,-1],[-1,0],[-1,1],[0,-1],[0,1],[1,-1],[1,0],[1,1]]
        queue = deque([(1, 0, 0)]) if grid[0][0] == 0 else deque()
        visited = set()
        
        while queue:
            dist, x, y = queue.popleft()
            if (x, y) == (N-1, N-1): return dist
            for dx, dy in neibs:
                if 0<=x+dx<N and 0<=y+dy<N and grid[x+dx][y+dy] == 0 and (x+dx, y+dy) not in visited:
                    visited.add((x+dx,y+dy))
                    queue.append((dist + 1, x+dx, y+dy))
                
        return -1
```
