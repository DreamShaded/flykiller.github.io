title: Leetcode 0713. Subarray Product Less Than K
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0713/
---

It is given that all numbers are natural, that is they are more or equal than `1`. The idea is to use two pointers (or sliding window) approach, where at each moment of time we try to extend our window. Let us `beg, end-1` be the beginning and end of our window (it means that if `beg=end=0`, our window is empty), `P` is current product of numbers in our window and `out` is our answer we need to return.

On each iteration, we extend our window by one number to the right: however we need to check first, that the product do not exceed `k`. So, we remove numbers from the beginning of our window, until product is less then `k`. Note also, that we can not have `end < beg`, so we break if it is the case: it means than our window becomes empty. Finally, we  update `out += end - beg + 1`: this is number of subarrays ending with `end` with product less than `k`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, because on each step we increase either `beg` or `end`. Space complexity is `O(1)`. 

```
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums, k):
        out, beg, end, P = 0, 0, 0, 1
        while end < len(nums):
            P *= nums[end]
            while end >= beg and P >= k:
                P /= nums[beg]
                beg += 1
            out += end - beg + 1
            end += 1
        return out
```
