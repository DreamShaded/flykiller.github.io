#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/

#### Solution
Let us count our numbers and start from the biggest one. Imagine it has frequency `freq`, this means, than there must be numbers `num - 1, ..., num - W + 1` with at least this frequencies. So, we check our stack and update frequencies.

#### Complexity
Complexity of sorting part is `O(m log m)`, where `n` is the number of different cards and complexity of working with stack is `O(n)`: on each step we reduce frequency of one of the elements by `1`: final time complexity is `O(m log m + n)`. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand, W):
        stack = sorted(Counter(hand).items())
        
        while stack:
            num, freq = stack.pop()
            addon = []
            for i in range(1, W):
                if not stack: return False
                num_n, freq_n = stack.pop()
                if num_n != num - i or freq_n < freq: return False
                if freq_n != freq: addon += [(num_n, freq_n - freq)]
            stack += addon[::-1]
    
        return True
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(n)` solution.

This problem is the same as **1296** Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers. See also similar problem **0659** Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences, where we need to divide in groups of any size    
`>= 3`.
