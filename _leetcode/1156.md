tags: [string, groupby, sliding window]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-for-longest-repeated-character-substring/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-for-longest-repeated-character-substring/

#### Solution
Here we can use functionality of python: we need to find either one full group and add element to the end if possible (for this we keep counter of all elements) or we need to have two groups of same value, where between we have another element with frequency `1`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxRepOpt1(self, S):
        A = [[c, len(list(g))] for c, g in groupby(S)]
        cnt = Counter(S)
        res = max(min(k + 1, cnt[c]) for c, k in A)
        for (v0, f0), (v1, f1), (v2, f2) in zip(A, A[1:], A[2:]):
            if v0 == v2 and f1 == 1:
                res = max(res, min(f0 + f2 + 1, cnt[v0]))
        return res
```
