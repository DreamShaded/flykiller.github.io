title: Leetcode 0179. Largest Number

Note, that we need to somehow sort our data, but be carefull about it: if we have `3`, `32` and `31`, then we need to choose `3` as the first element. However if we have `3`, `34` and `32`, then we need to chose `34` as the first element. So, let us for each two numbers `x` and `y` decide which one is better: we need to compare `xy` and `yx` and choose the best one: we work with `x` and `y` as with strings: for example for `x = 3` and `y = 32`, we need to compare `xy = 332` and `yx = 323`. Also it can be shown that if `xy >= yx` and `yz >= zy`, then `xz >= zx`, this means that we have transitivity property, and this is enough to ensure that our sort is consistent: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort 

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n log n)`, if we assume that we can make comparison in constant time. In practise, we use strings and compare them, so complexity will be ineed `O(1)`. Space complexity is `O(n)` to keep sorted numbers.

**Note** I use `cmp_to_key` function from `functools` library, which is imported in leetcode already. Also in the end we can have results like `00`, which we need to make `0`, so we use `str(int(...))` trick.

```
class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums):
        compare = lambda a, b: -1 if a+b > b+a else 1 if a+b < b+a else 0
        return str(int("".join(sorted(map(str, nums), key = cmp_to_key(compare)))))
```
