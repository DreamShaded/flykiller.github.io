#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Find-the-Largest-Number-in-a-Rotated-List/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Find-the-Largest-Number-in-a-Rotated-List/

#### Solution
Almost the same as Leetcode 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array, but here we need to find maximum.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        def dfs(start, end):
            if end - start <=  1:
                return max(nums[(start-1)%n], nums[start])

            mid = (start + end)//2
            if nums[end] > nums[mid]:
                return dfs(start, mid)
            else:
                return dfs(mid + 1, end)

        return dfs(0, len(nums) - 1)
```
