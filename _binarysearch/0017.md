#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Labyrinthian-Possibilities/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Labyrinthian-Possibilities/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0063. Unique Paths II.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, M):
        m, n = len(M), len(M[0])
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        dp[0][0] = int(M[0][0] == 0)
        for i, j in product(range(m), range(n)):
            if M[i][j] == 1: continue
            if i > 0: dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]
            if j > 0: dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]
                
        return dp[-1][-1] % (10**9 + 7)
```
