#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Majority-Vote/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Majority-Vote/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0169 Majority Element, but check that frequency is enough.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for additional space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        cnt, cand = 0, None
        
        for num in nums:
            if cnt == 0: cand = num
            cnt += (1 if num == cand else -1)
            
        return cand if nums.count(cand) > len(nums)//2 else -1
```
