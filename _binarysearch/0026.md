#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Palindromic-Subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Palindromic-Subsequence/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0516 Longest Palindromic Subsequence

#### Complexity
Time complexity will be `O(n^2)`, space complexity is `O(n^2)`, which can be reduced to `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if j - i <= 1: return j - i
            if s[i] == s[j-1]: 
                return dp(i + 1, j - 1) + 2
            else:
                return max(dp(i, j-1), dp(i + 1, j))
                
        return dp(0, len(s))
```
