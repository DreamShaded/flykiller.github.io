#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-ors-of-subarrays/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-ors-of-subarrays/

#### Solution
The idea of solution is the following: let `dp(i)` be all answers for subarrays which end with `i`-th element. Then it can be shown, that there is not more than `O(log W)` of them, where `W` is the bound for numbers values: we have sequence of embedded subarrays, which has monotonic property: number of ones in binary representation can only increase. 

To evaluate `dp(i)` we look at all solutions for `dp(i-1)` and `OR` them with `arr[i]`. Also we need to consider `arr[i]` value itself. In the end we intersect all sets we have and give answer.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n log W)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, arr):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i == 0: return tuple([arr[0]])
            return tuple(set(arr[i]|j for j in dp(i-1) + (0,)))
        
        return len({j for i in range(len(arr)) for j in dp(i)})
```
