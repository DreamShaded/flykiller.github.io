#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/

#### Solution
Quite painful problem, for me the easiest way is the following: go from left to right and when we see open bracket `(`, we  do recursion, when we see closed bracket `(`, we return the evaluated value and the current place, where we finished. If we see `+` or `-`, we put elements in stack, if we see `*` and `/`, we update last element in stack. See problem **0227** Basic Calculator II for more explanations.

#### Complexity
Time and memory complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s):    
        def calc(it):
            def update(op, v):
                if op == "+": stack.append(v)
                if op == "-": stack.append(-v)
        
            num, stack, sign = 0, [], "+"
            
            while it < len(s):
                if s[it].isdigit():
                    num = num * 10 + int(s[it])
                elif s[it] in "+-":
                    update(sign, num)
                    num, sign = 0, s[it]
                elif s[it] == "(":
                    num, j = calc(it + 1)
                    it = j - 1
                elif s[it] == ")":
                    update(sign, num)
                    return sum(stack), it + 1
                it += 1
            update(sign, num)
            return sum(stack)

        return calc(0)
```

#### Remark
If we do not have `*` and `/`, then algorithm can be simplified, actually what we need is sigh of number in the end and we need to change it depending on our brackets.
