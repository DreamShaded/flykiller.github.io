#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Multi-Knapsack/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Multi-Knapsack/

#### Solution
Classical dp problem, where state is `(taken weigth, taken count, index)`. On each step we can either take or not take new item. We can do it either with recursion or we can do it layer by layer, from `index` generate all element with `index + 1`.


#### Complexity
It is `O(cap * n^2)` for time and `O(cap * n)` for space.


#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, W, values, cap, count):
        n = len(W)
        dp = {(0, 0): 0}
        for i in range(n):
            dp2 = Counter()
            for w, t in dp:
                dp2[w, t] = max(dp2[w, t], dp[w, t])
                if w + W[i] <= cap and t + 1 <= count:
                    dp2[w + W[i], t + 1] = max(dp2[w + W[i], t + 1], dp[w, t] + values[i])
            dp = dp2

        return max(dp.values())
```
