#### Problem A statement
[math]

<a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1651/problem/A"> <font color = blue>https://codeforces.com/contest/1651/problem/A

#### Solution
We just can return answer directly.

#### Complexity
It is `O(1)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
I = lambda: [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    print((1<<n) - 1)
```


#### Problem B statement
[constructive, math, greedy]

<a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1651/problem/B"> <font color = blue>https://codeforces.com/contest/1651/problem/B

#### Solution
We can notice that for example to exist we need any two numbers be at `>= 3` times different. So, if we construct `[1, 3, 9, ...]` and maximal number is smaller than `10**9`, we can construct, and we can not in the opposite case.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
I = lambda: [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    ans = [1]
    for i in range(30):
        if ans[-1] * 3 > 10**9: break
        ans += [ans[-1] * 3]
 
    if n >= 20:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(" ".join(str(x) for x in ans[:n]))
```


#### Problem C statement
[greedy, graph]

<a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1651/problem/C"> <font color = blue>https://codeforces.com/contest/1651/problem/C

#### Solution
We need to connect the first and the last elements for both arrays. We can either connect them with each other or we can connect them with smaller element from the opposite array. If we have `A` and `B` for left ends, we can have two options: connecte with each other or connect with minimum from the opposite, the same is for the right ends. Also we have case with `A` and `B[::-1]`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python

I = lambda: [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 
def check(A, B):
    t1 = min(abs(a - B[0]) for a in A)
    t2 = min(abs(b - A[0]) for b in B)
    t3 = abs(A[0] - B[0])
    t4 = min(abs(a - B[-1]) for a in A)
    t5 = min(abs(b - A[-1]) for b in B)
    t6 = abs(A[-1] - B[-1])
    return min(t1 + t2, t3) + min(t4 + t5, t6)
 
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    A = I()
    B = I()
    print(min(check(A, B), check(A, B[::-1])))
```


#### Problem D statement
[bfs, graph]

<a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1651/problem/D"> <font color = blue>https://codeforces.com/contest/1651/problem/D


#### Solution
The idea is the following:
1. Put all border points to queue, that is all points, which have at least one empty neighbour.
2. Start multisource bfs, where we go only `inside` our points, that is visit only points from our set: if we found closer elements, we update our dictionary.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
from collections import deque
I = lambda: [int(i) for i in input().split()]

n = int(input())
pts = [tuple(I()) for _ in range(n)]
dist = {p: (-1, -1, int(1e9)) for p in pts}
d = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
Q = deque()

for ix, iy in pts:
    for dx, dy in d:
        nx, ny = ix + dx, iy + dy
        if (nx, ny) not in dist: dist[(ix, iy)] = (nx, ny, 1)
    if dist[(ix, iy)][2] == 1:
        Q.append((ix, iy))

while Q:
    x, y = Q.popleft()
    cx, cy, cd = dist[(x, y)]
    for dx, dy in d:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if (nx, ny) in dist and cd + 1 < dist[(nx, ny)][2]:
            dist[(nx, ny)] = cx, cy, cd + 1
            Q.append((nx, ny))

for i in range(n):
    print(' '.join(map(str, dist[pts[i]][:2])))
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(n sqrt(n))` time complexity solution, which can get AC in faster languages: the idea is for each point be able to find the leftest and the rightest empty place. Then for each point we can go from `-sqrt(n//2)` to `sqrt(n//2)` by `y` coordinate and find the closest leftest and rightest places.
