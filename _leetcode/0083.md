tags: [linked list]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/

#### Solution
Go from left to right and check if the current value is equal to the next value.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space, because we modified original list.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        curr = head
        while curr and curr.next:
            if curr.next.val == curr.val:
                curr.next = curr.next.next
            else:
                curr = curr.next
        return head
```
