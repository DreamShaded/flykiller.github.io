#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/

#### Solution
Note, that if we take minus logarithms of our probabilities, what we actually need to find is shortest distance between `start` and `end`. Classical way to do it is to use Dijkstra algorithm.

#### Complexity
Time complexity `O(E + V * log V)` if we use heap as in the following code.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProbability(self, n, edges, succProb, start, end):
        dist = [float('inf')] * n
        dist[start] = 0
        G = defaultdict(list)
        
        for i, (a, b) in enumerate(edges):
            G[a].append((b, -math.log(succProb[i])))
            G[b].append((a, -math.log(succProb[i])))
        
        heap = [(0, start)]

        while heap:
            min_dist, idx = heappop(heap)
            if idx == end: return math.exp(-min_dist)
            for neibh, weight in G[idx]:
                cand = min_dist + weight
                if cand < dist[neibh]:
                    dist[neibh] = cand
                    heappush(heap, (cand, neibh))
                    
        return 0
```
