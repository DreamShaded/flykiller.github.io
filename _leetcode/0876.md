title: Leetcode 0876 Middle of the Linked List
tags: [linked list, two pointers]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/

#### Solution
Use two pointers: slow and fast, when fast will reach the end, slow one will be in the middle of list.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n) ~ 1.5n`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head):
        slow = head
        fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow
```
