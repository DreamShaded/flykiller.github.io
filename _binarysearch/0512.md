#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Tree-Coloring/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Tree-Coloring/

#### Solution
Any tree is bipartite graph. So, we need to check that we have enough colors for each part.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(h)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, root):
        cols = Counter()
        deps = [0, 0]
        def dfs(node, d):
            if not node: return
            cols[node.val] += 1
            deps[d%2] += 1
            dfs(node.left, d + 1)
            dfs(node.right, d + 1)
        
        dfs(root, 0)
        A, B = sorted(list(cols.values())), sorted(deps)
        A = [0]*(2 - len(A)) + A
        return A == B
```
