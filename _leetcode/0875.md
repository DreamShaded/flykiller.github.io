title: Leetcode 0875 Koko Eating Bananas
tags: [binary search]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/

#### Solution
The idea is given value `mid`, answer a question: can Koko eat all bananas within `H` hours. We need `sum(ceil(i/mid) for i in piles)` hours to eat all bananas. Then we just do binary search and find the first place, where time is `<= H`. We always keep invariant: `time(beg) > H` and `time(end) <= H`, we can do it, because function `time` is not-increasing.

#### Complexity
Time Complexity: `O(N log W)`, where `N` is the number of piles, and `W` is the maximum size of a pile, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles, H):
        beg, end = 0, max(piles)
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if sum(ceil(i/mid) for i in piles) > H:
                beg = mid
            else:
                end = mid
                
        return end
```
