#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-distance-in-a-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-distance-in-a-binary-tree/

#### Solution
Basically what is asked here is to find LCA of two nodes and then find distances from both nodes to this LCA. We can do this in one pass as well.

Let `dfs(node, lvl)` be number of nodes from `(p, q)` in subtree with root `node`, which has `lvl` distance from root of wholet ree.

0. `if p == q`, we return `0`.
1. We run recursively `dfs` to get `lft` and `rgh`.
2. `mid` is `1` if one of `p` or `q` is equal to `node` and zero in opposite case.
3. `if mid > 0` it means, that we found one of nodes `p, q`, so we add lengh from root to `node`.
4. `if lft + rgh + mid >= 2`, it means, that we found LCA, we subtract `2*lvl` from answer.
5. Finally, we return `max(lft, mid, rgh)` is number of nodes from `p, q` found in subtree. 

Notice, that we can have only one node, where `lft + rgh + mid >= 2` and it is our LCA.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findDistance(self, root: TreeNode, p, q):
        def dfs(node, lvl):
            if not node: return 0
   
            lft = dfs(node.left, lvl + 1)
            rgh = dfs(node.right, lvl + 1)
            mid = node.val in (p, q)
            if mid > 0: self.ans += lvl
            if lft + rgh + mid >= 2: self.ans -= 2*lvl
            return max(lft, mid, rgh)
        
        if p == q: return 0
        self.ans = 0
        dfs(root, 0)
        return self.ans 
```
