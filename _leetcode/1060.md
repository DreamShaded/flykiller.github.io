title: Leetcode 1060 Missing Element in Sorted Array
tags: [binary search, array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-element-in-sorted-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-element-in-sorted-array/

#### Solution
Very similar to problem **1539**. Kth Missing Positive Number, but here we need to shift `k` to `k + arr[0] - 1`, because we need to start with `arr[0]` and not `0`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log n)`, space complexity is `O(1)` if we do not count input data.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def missingElement(self, arr, k):
        beg, end = 0, len(arr)
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end) // 2
            if arr[mid] - mid < k + arr[0]:
                beg = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid
        return end + k + arr[0] - 1
```
