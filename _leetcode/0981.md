#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/

#### Solution
Keep for every `key` pari `(value, timestamp)`. For `get` funtcion use binary search, notice that we need to use key `(timestamp, element > z)`. Be careful, "Z" is smaller than `z`!, so use `{` for example.

#### Complexity
It is `O(1)` for append and `O(log n)` for `get`.

#### Code
```python
class TimeMap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.t_v = defaultdict(list)

    def set(self, key, value, timestamp):
        self.t_v[key].append((timestamp, value))

    def get(self, key, timestamp):
        i = bisect.bisect(self.t_v[key], (timestamp, "{") )
        return self.t_v[key][i - 1][1] if i else ""
```
