#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz-multithreaded/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz-multithreaded/

#### Solution
We need to traverse our tree, where `dfs(node)` will return maximum path, which go from `node` to any leaf. Using this information we can find diameter: for each node we check two longest paths for its children and take their sum plus 2.
In the end we check all longest paths going through all nodes, so we will find our answer.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)` to traverse our tree: note, that length of `maxs` will always be not more than `2`. Space complexity is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def treeDiameter(self, edges):
        G = defaultdict(list)
        for x, y in edges:
            G[x] += [y]
            G[y] += [x]
            
        V, self.res = set(), 0
        
        def dfs(node):
            V.add(node)
            maxs = [-1, -1]
            for neib in G[node]:
                if neib in V: continue
                depth = dfs(neib)
                maxs = sorted(maxs + [depth])[-2:]
            self.res = max(self.res, sum(maxs) + 2)
            return maxs[1] + 1
        
        dfs(0)
        return self.res
```
