#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/

#### Solution
See similar Problems **0041**: First Missing positive and **0442**: Find All Duplicates in an Array. We an either swap elements, or use trick where we add `n` to all values of already found element. and then return indexes of elements which are `<= n`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, additional space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        for num in nums:
            nums[(num-1) % n] += n
            
        return [i+1 for i in range(n) if nums[i] <= n]
```
