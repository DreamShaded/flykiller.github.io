The main idea you need to understand to solve this problem that it is a graph problem. We have list of rooms - nodes and for each room you have list of keys, this is edges which go from this node. Problem is asking if you can traverse all graph, starting from node `0`. As usual, there are different ways to do it:
1. iterative `dfs` with stack
2. recursive `dfs` without explicit stack (however we have implicit stack)
3. `bfs`, using queue.

Whenever I can I choose recursive `dfs`, because it is the easiest to code: we keep set of visited nodes, and for `dfs(room)` we try to visit all new rooms which we can open with keys, which we did not visit yet, run then to visited set and run `dfs` recursively. In the end we check that length of visited set is equal to length of total number of rooms.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(N+E)`, where `N` is number of rooms ans `E` is total number of keys. Space complexity is `O(N)` - size of `visited` and size of implicit stack as well.

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms):
        visited = set([0])
        
        def dfs(room):
            for neib in rooms[room]:
                if neib not in visited:
                    visited.add(neib)
                    dfs(neib)
                    
        dfs(0)
        return len(visited) == len(rooms)    
```

### Oneliner, just for fun:
Idea is to construct adjacency matrix and then use matrix exponent to understand if we can reach nodes or not.
```
from scipy.sparse.linalg import expm

class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms):
        return 0 not in expm([[j in r + [i] for j in range(len(rooms))] for i,r in enumerate(rooms)])[0]
```
