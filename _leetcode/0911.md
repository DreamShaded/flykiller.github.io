#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/online-election/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/online-election/
	

#### Solution
The idea is to precalculate who is winner for all elements in `times`. The trick is that each moment of time when we have new person `idx` arriving, winner can be previous winner we have or if `cnt[idx] >= votes[1]`, then we have new winner. In `votes` we keep tuple `(id of winner, number of voices)`. To get query we need to perfrom binary search.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n + q log n)`, where `n = len(times)` and `q` is number of queries.

#### Code
```python
class TopVotedCandidate:
    def __init__(self, persons, times):
        self.data = []
        cnt = Counter()
        votes = (-1, 0)
        
        for idx, time in zip(persons, times):
            cnt[idx] += 1
            if cnt[idx] >= votes[1]:
                votes = (idx, cnt[idx])
                
            self.data.append((time, votes[0]))
            
    def q(self, t):
        i = bisect.bisect(self.data, (t, float('inf')))
        return self.data[i-1][1]
