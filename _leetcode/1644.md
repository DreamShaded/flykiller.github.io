#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-ii/

#### Solution
One way to solve this problem is to use so-called euler traversal of tree, which loos like `root -> left -> root -> right -> root`. Then to find LSA we need to find any indexes in euler traversel (it can be several indexes, we can take any) and find node with smallest depth between them.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        self.arr, self.dep = [], []  #euler path
        def dfs(node, depth):
            self.arr += [node]
            self.dep += [depth]
            for child in filter(None, [node.left, node.right]):
                dfs(child, depth + 1)
                self.arr += [node]
                self.dep += [depth]
            
        dfs(root, 0)
        if p not in self.arr or q not in self.arr: return None
        i1, i2 = self.arr.index(p), self.arr.index(q)
        i1, i2 = min(i1, i2), max(i1, i2)

        return self.arr[min(range(i1, i2), key = lambda x: self.dep[x])]
```
