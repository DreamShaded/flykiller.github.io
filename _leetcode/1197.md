#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/

#### Solution
We can solve this problem with classical bfs.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is potentially upto `O(x*y)`, with quite big constant, space complexity as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minKnightMoves(self, x, y):
        queue = deque([(0, 0, 0)])
        dirs = [(1,2),(1,-2),(-1,2),(-1,-2),(2,1),(-2,1),(2,-1),(-2,-1)]
        V = set((0, 0))
        
        while queue:
            steps, i, j = queue.popleft()
            if (x, y) == (i, j): return steps
            V.add((i, j))
            for dx, dy in dirs:
                if (i + dx, j + dy) in V: continue
                V.add((i + dx, j + dy))
                queue.append((steps + 1, i + dx, j + dy))
```

#### Remark
It is also possible to solve this problem with `dp`. There is also direct formula in `O(1)` can be derived!
