### Explanations
The main trick is to count for each possible number of citations, how many times we see this number in our `citations`. Note, that if number of citations is more than total number of papers `N`, we can reduce this numer to `N` and nothing will change. Let me explain my solutoin given test example `[3,0,6,1,5]`.
1. We create array, which I called `buckets = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]`, where `buckets[i]` is number of papers with `i` citations if `i < N` and `bucket[N]` is number of papers with `>=N` citations.
2. Now, we create `accum` array, where `accum[0]` is number of papers with `>=1` citation, `accum[1]` is number of papers with `>=2` citations and so on. When we evaluate it for our example we can see, that it is equal to `accum = [4,3,3,2,2]`. Note, that we start with 1 citation, not with zero, that is why we need to use `accum[1:]` in our code.
3. Finally, we need to go through this array and find the bigest number `i`, for which `accum[i] >= i + 1` and return `i + 1`, in our example it is equal to `3`.

### Complexity
Complexity is O(n), though we traverse our data 4 times, and it is not the optimal solution. We can evaluate cumulative sums in place, and compare them in place with `i + 1` and keep the index of maximum reached so far, and interrupt when inequality `accum[i] >= i + 1` does not hold anymore. Howerer I like cumulative sums and code is more clean in my way.

### Code

```
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        N = len(citations)
        buckets = [0] * (N + 1)
        
        for elem in citations:
            buckets[min(elem, N)] += 1
        
        accum = list(accumulate(buckets[1:][::-1]))[::-1]  
        compar = [accum[i] >= i + 1 for i in range(N)]  
        return (compar + [0]).index(0)
