tags: [graph, bfs]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/walls-and-gates/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/walls-and-gates/

#### Solution
Just perform classical bfs, where at the beginning we put all gates to our queue. Then on each iteration extract node from queue, check neighbours and if they are not visited, add them to queue.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(mn)$, space is $O(mn)$ as well, because potentially queue can have this size.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms):
        m, n = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
        queue = deque()
        
        for i, j in product(range(m), range(n)):
            if rooms[i][j] == 0:
                queue.append((0, i, j))
                    
        while queue:
            dist, x, y = queue.popleft()
            for dx, dy in [(x, y+1), (x, y-1), (x-1, y), (x+1, y)]:
                if 0 <= dx < m and 0 <= dy < n and rooms[dx][dy] == 2**31 - 1:
                    rooms[dx][dy] = dist + 1
                    queue.append((dist + 1, dx, dy))
```
