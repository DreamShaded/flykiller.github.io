#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-equal-frequency/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-equal-frequency/

#### Solution
The idea is to keep Counter cnt of numbers as well as for each frequency keep how many numbers we have with this frequency.
For example for `[3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7]` we have frequencies `[2, 3, 2, 2, 3]` and hence we have `freqs[2] = 3` and `freqs[3] = 2`. When we add new number, we:

1. Check how many times we seen this number before, if we seen it before, decrease `freqs[f]` by `1`.
2. If we have empty `freqs[f]`, that is we do not have elements with frequency `f` anymore, pop it, we do not want to have zero elements.
3. Increase `freqs[f + 1]` by one, because now we have one more element with frequency `f + 1`. Also update `cnt[num]`.

Now, we need to look at our freqs counter and check:

1. If we have length more than `2`, continue, it means that we have at least `3` different frequencies, we can not make them all equal.
2. If we have length equal to `1`, it means, that we have all element with the same frequency. In this case, two options are ok for us: either all frequencies equal to `1`, like in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` or we have only one value, like `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Other cases, like `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]` are not OK, because we need to remove exactly one element.
3. If we have length equal to `2`, then two options are OK for us:
if we have pair `(1, 1), (x, y)`, that is we have `A, y_1, ..., y_1, ..., y_x, ... y_x` (`1` element of frequency `1` and `x` elements of frequency `y`) and we can remove the first one. Or we can have `(1, y+1), (x, y)` case, then we have one element of frequency `y+1` and `x` elements of frequency `y`. Finally, we can have `(x, y)`, `(1, y+1)` case, because we can not sure in which order we have elements in our `t`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxEqualFreq(self, nums):
        cnt, freqs, ans = Counter(), Counter(), 1

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            f = cnt[num]
            if f > 0: freqs[f] -= 1
            if f in freqs and freqs[f] == 0: freqs.pop(f)
            freqs[f + 1] += 1
            cnt[num] += 1
            
            if len(freqs) > 2: continue
            t = list(freqs.items())
             
            if len(t) == 1 and 1 in t[0]:
                ans = max(ans, i)
                
            if len(t) == 2:
                (a, b), (c, d) = t
                if (1, 1) in t or b*(a-c) == 1 or d*(c-a) == 1:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
             
        return ans + 1
```
