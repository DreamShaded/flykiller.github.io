title: Leetcode 1437. Check If All 1s Are at Least Length K Places Away
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1437/
---

Easy problem, we just need to iterate over numbers and keep distance `dist` to the last occurence of `1`.
1. If we meet `0`, we need to increase distance by `1`.
2. If we meet `1` and current distance is more or equal than `k`, than everything is OK and we need to update `dist = 0`.
3. If we meet `1` and current distance is less than `k`, than there will be two `1` placed less than `k` indexes away, so we can immedietly return `False`.
4. In the end we return `True` if we reached this place.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)` to pass over our data once, space comlexity is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums, k):
        dist = k
        
        for num in nums:
            if num == 0: dist += 1
            elif num == 1 and dist >= k: dist = 0
            else: return False
                
        return True
```
