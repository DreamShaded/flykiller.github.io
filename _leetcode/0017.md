#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/

#### Solution

One way to solve this problem is to do backtracking. However we can use functionality of python `product` function, which will do almost everything for us. What is product? It is casterian product of two objects, for example if we have `ob1 = [a, b, c]` and `ob2 = [d, e]`, then `product(ob1, ob2) = [ad, bd, cd, ae, be, ce]`. And this is almost what we need:
1. In fact what will be returned are lists, so we need to join them.
2. We need product of not `2` but several objects, and we will use `*` notation for this.

#### Complexity
Both time and space is `O(3^m*4^n*(m+n))`, where `m` is number of digits for which we have `3` options and `n` is number of letters for which we have `4` options, because we have `3^m*4^n` options with `m+n` length each.

```
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits):
        if not digits: return []
        d = {"2":"abc", "3":"def", "4":"ghi", "5":"jkl", "6":"mno", "7":"pqrs", "8":"tuv", "9":"wxyz"}
        return ["".join(num) for num in product(*[d[i] for i in digits])]
```
