#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

#### Solution
Simple problem, but it is good to investigate --- it has a lot of different solutions. There is a simple hashtable solution with time and memory complexity `O(n)`, there is a sorting solution with `O(n * log n)` time and `O(1)` memory. 

Remember, that we did not use the fact, that majority element is in more than half place. Finally there is Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, with time complexity `O(n)` and space complexity `O(1)`: the idea is to keep track of current most popular element and if new element is equal to the most popular, we add 1, if not equal, we subtract -1. If we have zero, we forget about all previous elements and update current most popular.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        cnt, cand = 0, None
        
        for num in nums:
            if cnt == 0: cand = num
            cnt += (1 if num == cand else -1)
            
        return cand
```

#### Remark
Also there is randomization solution with expected linear time and constant memory.
