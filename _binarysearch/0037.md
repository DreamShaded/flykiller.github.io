#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Unidirectional-Word-Search/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Unidirectional-Word-Search/

#### Solution
For each row and column apply string search, using `in` function in python.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and `O(m + n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board, word):
        for row in board:
            if word in "".join(row): return True
        for col in zip(*board):
            if word in "".join(col): return True
        return False
```
