#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Social-Distancing/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Social-Distancing/

#### Solution
Use groupby and check condition for every border and middle groups.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, k):
        I = []
        for x, y in groupby(s):
            if x == ".": I += [len(list(y))]
        if s[0] == "x": I = [0] + I
        if s[-1] == "x": I = I + [0]
        if I[0] >= k or I[-1] >= k: return True
        if any(x >= 2*k - 1 for x in I[1:-1]): return True
        return False
```
