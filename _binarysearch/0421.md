#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Submajority-Vote/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Submajority-Vote/

#### Solution
Almost equal to Leetcode 0229. Majority Element II. Sort in the end.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        count = Counter()
        for num in nums:
            count[num] += 1
            if len(count) == 3:
                new_count = Counter()
                for elem, freq in count.items(): 
                    if freq != 1: new_count[elem] = freq - 1
                count = new_count
                    
        cands = Counter(num for num in nums if num in count)      
        return sorted([num for num in cands if cands[num] > len(nums)/3])
```
