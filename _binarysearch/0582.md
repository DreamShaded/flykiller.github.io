#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Divisible-Sublist/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Divisible-Sublist/

#### Solution
Variation of Leetcode 0974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K. We can calculate number of sublist and check that it is greater than number of lists with length `1`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
        cnt = Counter()
        for x in acc:
            cnt[x%k] += 1

        return sum(x*(x-1)//2 for x in cnt.values()) > sum(x%k == 0 for x in nums)
```
