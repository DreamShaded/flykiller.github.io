#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/image-smoother/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/image-smoother/

#### Solution
There are a lot of different ways to code this problem, here is solution using convolutions: it can potentially work faster for bigger kernels. What we need to do is to evaluate two convolutions: one with matrix `M` and another with matrix with all ones - in this way we understand how many terms we have, and then divide one by another.

#### Complexity
It is `O(9mn)` for time and `O(mn)` for space.

#### Code
```python
from scipy.ndimage import convolve
import numpy as np

class Solution:
    def imageSmoother(self, M):
        m, n = len(M), len(M[0])
        T = [[1]*n for _ in range(m)]
        k = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
        t1 = convolve(M, k, mode = "constant")
        t2 = convolve(T, k, mode = "constant")
        return [[i//j for i, j in zip(r1, r2)] for r1, r2 in zip(t1, t2)]
```

#### Remark
Or just do what is asked in `O(9mn)` time, iterating all pixels. We can also do it in place if instead 8 bits we will create 16 bits numbers and first write data to the last 8 bits and in the second run we remove first 8 bits.
