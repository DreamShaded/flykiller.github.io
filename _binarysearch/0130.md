#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Consecutive-Sequence/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Consecutive-Sequence/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        set_nums, ans = set(nums), 0
        for num in nums:
            if num - 1 in set_nums: continue
                
            nxt = num
            while nxt + 1 in set_nums:
                nxt += 1
            ans = max(ans, nxt-num+1)
                
        return ans
```
