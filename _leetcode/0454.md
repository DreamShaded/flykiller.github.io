Let us look at pairs of numbers from `A` and `B` and calculate all `O(n^2)` of them. Next, we look at all pairs from `C` and `D` and again calculate all of them. Now, our problem is reduced to **2-sum** problem: we need to find two numbers from two lists, such that sum of them equal to `0`. There is couple of moments we need to care about:

1. There can be duplicates, so we keep `Counter()` for our sums.
2. When we update `ans`, we check how many numbers we have in first counter and multiply it by how many times we have for opposite number.

**Complexity**: total complexity is `O(n^2)` to look at all pairs from `(A, B)` and `(C, D)`. Space complexity is also `O(n^2)`. One possible optimization is to first create counters from our lists and work with them directly.

```python
class Solution:
    def fourSumCount(self, A, B, C, D):
        Cnt1, Cnt2, ans = Counter(), Counter(), 0
        for a, b in product(A, B):
            Cnt1[a + b] += 1
            
        for c, d in product(C, D):
            Cnt2[c + d] += 1
            
        for val in Cnt1:
            if -val in Cnt2:
                ans += Cnt1[val]*Cnt2[-val]
                
        return ans
```
