title: Leetcode 0978 Longest Turbulent Subarray
tags: [sliding window, dp, array]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-turbulent-subarray/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-turbulent-subarray/

#### Solution
Let us define `dp(i, dr)` is the longest turbulent subarray, which ends with position `i` and such that its last step was incresing if `dr = 1` and decreasing if `dr = -1`. Then:

1. if `i == 0`, answer is `1`. Also if `(A[i] - A[i-1]) * dr >= 0`, it means that we can not continue the previous turbulent subarray, we also return `1`.
2. In the opposite case we return `dp(i-1, -dr) + 1`, where we change direction from `dr` to `-dr`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)`, because we have `O(n)` states and each state processed in `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxTurbulenceSize(self, A):
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, dr):
            if i == 0 or (A[i] - A[i-1])*dr >= 0: return 1
            return dp(i-1, -dr) + 1
        
        return max(dp(i, dr) for i in range(len(A)) for dr in [-1, 1])
