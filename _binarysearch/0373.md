#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Repeating-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Repeating-String/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0459. Repeated Substring Pattern.

#### Complexity
Complexity of this solution is `O(n * sqrt(n))` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        N = len(s)
        for i in range(1, N//2+1):
            if N % i == 0 and s[:i]* (N//i) == s:
                return True
        return False
```

#### Remark
There is also linear time solution, but it gives TLE, because it is linear in average and for special cases it can broke complexity. If we want to have true linear, use KMP.
