#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Maximum-Removal-Subsequence-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Maximum-Removal-Subsequence-String/

#### Solution
Let us apply algorithm where we checked that `t` is subsequence of `s`, but now we keep places as well. For example if `s = xaababcbac` and `t = abac`, we have places `1, 3, 4, 6`. Do the same logic from the end - for reversed strings: here it will be `0, 1, 2, 5`, after normalization it is `9, 8, 7, 4`. Then Imagine that we take `1` element from start and `3` from end, then we have `1` index where prefix ends and `8` index where suffix starts, so gap is `6`. We do it for all pairs.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, t):
        def isSubsequence(s, t):
            si, ti, ans = 0, 0, []
            
            while si < len(s) and ti < len(t):
                if s[si] == t[ti]:
                    ans += [ti]
                si, ti = si + (s[si] == t[ti]), ti + 1
            return ans

        n = len(s)
        a1 = isSubsequence(t, s) 
        a2 = isSubsequence(t[::-1], s[::-1])
        ans = n - 1 - min(a1[-1], a2[-1])
        for x, y in zip(a1, a2[::-1][1:]):
            ans = max(ans, n - 2 - y - x)

        return ans
```
