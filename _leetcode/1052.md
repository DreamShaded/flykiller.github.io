#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/

#### Solution
First of all, let as evaluate `ans` is the number of customers that always satisfied.
Also evaluate `cost` is array of additional customers which can be satisfied with secred technique.
All we need to do now is to find the window of length `M` with the biggest sum in this array.
It can be done using sliding window or cumulative sums.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSatisfied(self, arr, G, M):
        ans = sum(x*(1 - y) for x, y in zip(arr, G))
        cost = [x*y for x, y in zip(arr, G)]
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(cost))
        gain = max(acc[i] - acc[i - M] for i in range(M, len(acc)))
        return ans + gain
```
