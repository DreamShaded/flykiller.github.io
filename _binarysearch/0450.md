#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Digital-Lake/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Digital-Lake/

#### Solution 1
Almost the same as Leetcode 1067 - Digit Count in Range, so we can reuse code.

#### Complexity
It is `O(k)`, where `k` is the length of the biggest among low and high. Note also, that here we use exponents of 10, which is in fact not truly `O(1)`, but for small values like we have we can assume that it is `O(1)`. If we imagine, that the problem need to be solved for much bigger numbers and get answer some module M, then this algorithm can be easily adapted to have `O(k)` complexity.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, d):
        def full(d, n):
            return 10**(n-1)*(9*n+1)//10 if d != 0 else 10**(n-1)*(9*n-9)//10

        l_str = str(n + 1)
        ans, k, q = 0, len(l_str), 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            t = int(l_str[i])
            q += (t == d)
            if t == 0 or t == 1 and i == 0 : continue
            part1 = int(10**(k-i-2)*(k-i-1)*(t-(i==0)))
            part2 = int(t-1 >= d) * 10**(k-i-1) if i > 0 or d > 0 else 0
            part3 = (q-(t==d)) * t * 10**(k-i-1)
            ans += part1 + part2 + part3
    
        return ans + sum(full(d, i) for i in range(1, k))
```

#### Solution 2
We can also make it easiry with recursion

Let's take `n = 845` as an example. We first calculate the answer for `n // 10 = 84`. Then if we multiply this answer by `10` and add `84`, we get the count for numbers between `1` and `849`. Then we manually count between `846` and `849` using `str.count()` and remove them.

One edge case is when d = 0, when we have to subtract one from the answer since we are counting starting from 1 instead of 0.

#### Complexity
It is `O(k^2)`, using previous solution notations. However it is possible to extend this algorithm to make it `O(k)`, if we pass `i` as parameter where we process `str(n)[:i]`.

#### Code
```python
### not mine code
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, d):
        if n < 10: return int(d <= n) - (d == 0)

        k = n // 10
        ans = self.solve(k, d) * 10 + k + (d != 0)

        m = n // 10 * 10 + 9
        while m > n:
            ans -= str(m).count(str(d))
            m -= 1
        return ans
```
