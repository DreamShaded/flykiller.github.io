#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Distinct-Coin-Sums/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Distinct-Coin-Sums/

#### Solution
Keep set of possible amounts and add coin by coin.

#### Complexity
If we have `T = max(C)`, then we can have values upto `T*n`. We have time complexity `O(T * n * m)` and space is `O(T * n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, C, Q):
        dp = set([0])
        for c, q in zip(C, Q):
            dp2 = set()
            for x in range(0, c*q + c, c):
                for val in dp:
                    dp2.add(x + val)
            dp = dp2
        return len(dp) - 1
```
