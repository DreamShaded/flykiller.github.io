#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/dot-product-of-two-sparse-vectors/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/dot-product-of-two-sparse-vectors/

#### Solution
All we need to do is for every vector keep only dictionary of non-zero coordinates. Then we iterate throuhg them and check only those we need.

#### Complexity
Time complexity for `init` is `O(n)`, where `n` is length of vector. Time complexity of `dotProduct` is `O(A + B)`, where `A` and `B` are numbers of non-zero elements.

#### Code
```python
class SparseVector:
	def __init__(self, A):
		self.m = {i: x for i, x in enumerate(A) if x}
        
	def dotProduct(self, vec):
		return sum([x * self.m.get(i, 0) for i, x in vec.m.items()])
```
