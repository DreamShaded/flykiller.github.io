The idea is to look at black and white cells in chess coloring. Then we can make steps `(x, y) -> (x+1, y)` or `(x, y) -> (x+1, y+1)`. How to deal with this problem now?

1. Then we will go through the columns from left to right, keeping the minimum (in size) set of cells in which the Robot should be. Then the transition to the next column will be like this. We go through the cells from bottom to top, which contain candy. For each cell, we find the nearest cell from our set (we find a robot), which is located above the current one. Then we will change the cell from the set to the current cell. If there is no robot from the set for the cell, then we need to increase the answer by 1 and add the robot to our current cell (we can assume that we added the robot to the topmost cell of the column and collected all the candies that were higher). Complexity will be `O(mn)`.

2. There is alternative: we can look at the problem as Longest Increasing Sequense problem! (add detalis) Complexity will be `O(mn log(mn))`.

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def process(A):
    A.sort()
    A = [-y for _, y in A]
    dp = [10**10] * (len(A) + 1)
    for el in A: dp[bisect_left(dp, el)] = el  
    return dp.index(10**10)

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    input()
    R, C = map(int, input().split())
    grid = [input() for _ in range(R)]
    A = [[], []]

    for r in range(R):
        for c in range(C):
            if grid[r][c] == "1":
                A[(r+c) % 2].append((c-r, -c-r))

    print(process(A[0]) + process(A[1]))
```
