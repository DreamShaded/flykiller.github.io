#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/

This is very very classical problem and I think already everything was said about different solutions. Here is another straightforward solution, where we use `lru_cache` function and recursion.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is just `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(n)` as well, because we use `lru_cache`.

#### Remark
Note, that there is also `O(log n)` time complexity solution as well if you need it for big `n` and evaluate given some modulo. However here `n` is very small and it is not worth it.

#### Code

```
class Solution:
    @lru_cache(None)
    def fib(self, N):
        return N if N <= 1 else self.fib(N-1) + self.fib(N-2)
```
