#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Removing-Parentheses/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Removing-Parentheses/

#### Solution
We need to check balance when we go from one and and from another.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space. Similar to Leetcode 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        bal = 0
        ans1 = 0
        for i in s:
            bal += 1 if i == "(" else -1
            if bal < 0: ans1 = max(ans1, -bal)

        bal = 0
        ans2 = 0
        for i in s[::-1]:
            bal += 1 if i == ")" else -1
            if bal < 0: ans2 = max(ans2, -bal)

        return ans1 + ans2
```
