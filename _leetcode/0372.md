#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/super-pow/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/super-pow/

#### Solution
Imagine, we need to evaluate `a^{5159}`, it is equal to `a^9 * (a^{10}) ^ {515}`. So, to evaluate `superPow{a, 5159}`, we need to evaluate it recurrently for `superPow(a**10, 515)` and multiply it by `a^9`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is length of `b`, space complexity is also `O(n)`. Space complexity can be reduced to `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def superPow(self, a, b):
        def helper(a, ind):
            if ind == 0:
                return pow(a, b[ind], N)
            else:
                return (helper(pow(a, 10, N), ind-1) * pow(a, b[ind], N)) % N
    
        N = 1337
        return helper(a, len(b) - 1)
```
