title: Leetcode 0238. Product of Array Except Self
tags: [array, accumulate]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

#### Solution
We can use cumulative products for boths sides and then multipy them elementwise.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` both for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        t1 = [1] + list(accumulate(nums, mul))[:-1]
        t2 = list(accumulate(nums[::-1], mul))[::-1][1:] + [1]
        return [x*y for x, y in zip(t1, t2)]
```

### Remark
For `O(1)` space complexity we can first create empty output array and then traverse it twice from different ends.
