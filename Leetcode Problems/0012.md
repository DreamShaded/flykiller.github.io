title: Leetcode 0012. Integer to Roman
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0012/
---

Let us look at Roman representation digit by digit and see how it works.
For last digit we can have 
`" ", I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX`
For next digit we can have 
`" ", X, XX, XXX, XL, L, LX, LXX, LXXX, XC`
and so on.

Notice, that we have exactly the same pattern here, but instead of `I, V, X`, we have `X, L, C` symbols. Let us use this idea and function `digit` to construct our number. We find last digit of integer representation of our number, create corresponding roman part and add it to the beginning of our answer.

**Complexity**: time complexity is just `O(1)`, because length is restricted by `15`. Space complexity is `O(1)` as well.

```
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num):
        def digit(a,b,c,dig):
            return ["",a,2*a,3*a,a+b,b,b+a,b+2*a,b+3*a,a+c][dig]
        
        l = ["I","V","X","L","C","D","M","!","!"]
        out, i = "", 0

        while num != 0:
            num, last = divmod(num, 10)
            out = digit(l[i], l[i+1], l[i+2], last) + out
            i += 2
        return out
```
