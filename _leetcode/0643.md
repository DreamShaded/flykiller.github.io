tags: [math, array, sliding window, accumulate]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked, using sliding window (alternative solution is to use cumulative sums).

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums, k):
        sm = sum(nums[:k])
        max_av = sm
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            sm += (nums[i] - nums[i-k])
            max_av = max(max_av, sm)
        return max_av/k
```
