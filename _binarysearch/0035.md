<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Packing-Boxes/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Packing-Boxes/

#### Solution
We can use functionality of groupby here.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        return [list(y) for x, y in groupby(nums)]
```
