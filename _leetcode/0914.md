#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards/

#### Solution
We just need to check if gcd of all frequencies is not equal to `1`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space if we assume that `gcd` is `O(1)` or `O(n log M)` in other case where `M = 2**32`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck):
        return reduce(gcd, list(Counter(deck).values())) != 1
```
