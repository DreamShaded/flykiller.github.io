#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-distances-in-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-distances-in-tree/

#### Solution
Let us first create graph `G` from our `edges`. Let us also use two different dfs functions:
 
1. `dfs(node, parent, depth)`, where `node` is current node we are in, `parent` is parent of current node and `depth` is depth of node. This function is used to traverse tree and for each node find two values: depth of node (how far it is from root) and also weight of node: how many nodes in subtree with given node. For example, for tree `[[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]` weights will be `[6, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1]`.
2. `dfs2(node, parent, w)`, where `node` and `parent` current node and its parent and `w` in answer for current node. How we can find answer for `neib` if we already now answer for node? It is `w + N - 2*weights[neib]`, because when we moved from `node` to `neib` not a lot changed: for `weights[neib]` number of nodes distanced increased by `1` and for `N - weights[neib]` number of nodes distances decreased by `1`.

Finally, we just run `dfs2(0, -1, sum(depths))`.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sumOfDistancesInTree(self, N, edges):
        G = defaultdict(set)
        for i, j in edges:
            G[i].add(j)
            G[j].add(i)
        
        def dfs(node, parent, depth):
            ans = 1
            for neib in G[node]:
                if neib != parent:
                    ans += dfs(neib, node, depth + 1)
            weights[node] = ans
            depths[node] = depth
            return ans
        
        def dfs2(node, parent, w):
            ans[node] = w
            for neib in G[node]:
                if neib != parent:
                    dfs2(neib, node, w + N - 2*weights[neib])
        
        weights, depths, ans = [0]*N, [0]*N, [0]*N
        dfs(0, -1, 0)
        dfs2(0, -1, sum(depths))
        
        return ans
```
