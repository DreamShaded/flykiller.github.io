#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-triangle-area/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-triangle-area/

#### Solution 1
One way to solve this problem is just check all possible triplets of points.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^3)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def largestTriangleArea(self, points):
        def area(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3):
            return abs(x1*(y2-y3) + x2*(y3-y1) + x3*(y1-y2))
        
        ans = 0
        for [x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3] in combinations(points, 3):
            ans = max(ans, area(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3))
        return ans/2
```


#### Solution 2
There is also `O(n^2)` solution, using convex hull: we need `O(n log n)` time to construct convex hull, using for example Graham Scan and then for each node on convex hull we can find triangle with biggest area in `O(n)`, so overall complexity of second step is `O(n^2)`. See `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.11035.pdf`, page 8 for details.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def largestTriangleArea(self, points):
        def cross(p1, p2, p3):
            return (p2[0]-p1[0])*(p3[1]-p1[1])-(p2[1]-p1[1])*(p3[0]-p1[0])
        
        def ConvexHull(points):
            start = min(points)
            points.pop(points.index(start))

            points.sort(key=lambda p: (atan2(p[1]-start[1],p[0]-start[0]),-p[1], p[0]))

            ans = [start]
            for p in points:
                ans.append(p)
                while len(ans) > 2 and cross(ans[-3], ans[-2], ans[-1]) < 0:
                    ans.pop(-2)
            return ans

        def rootTriangle(a):
            ans, c = 0, (a + 2) % n
            for b in range(a+1, a+n):
                while abs(cross(H[a], H[b%n], H[(c+1)%n])) >= abs(cross(H[a], H[b%n], H[c])):
                    c = (c + 1) % n
                ans = max(ans, abs(cross(H[a], H[b%n], H[c%n])))
            return ans
        
        H = ConvexHull(points)
        n = len(H)
        return max(rootTriangle(a) for a in range(n))/2
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(n log n)` time complexity solution, using the same article, which is quite difficult to implement, but which is quite interesting to investigate, the idea is divide and conquer.
