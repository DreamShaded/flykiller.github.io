<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Partition-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Partition-String/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0763. Partition Labels.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(26)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, S):
        ends = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(S)}        
        curr, out = 0, [0]
        
        while curr < len(S):
            last = ends[S[curr]]
            while curr <= last:
                symb = S[curr]
                last = max(last, ends[symb])
                curr += 1
            out.append(curr)
        
        return [out[i]-out[i-1] for i in range(1, len(out))]
```
