#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Remove-Duplicates-in-Linked-List/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Remove-Duplicates-in-Linked-List/

#### Solution
Just traverse list and keep set of visited nodes.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, node):
        V = set()
        head = node
        prev = None
        while node is not None:
            if node.val in V:
                prev.next = node.next
                node = node.next
                continue
            V.add(node.val)
            prev = node
            node = node.next
        return head
```
