title: Leetcode 1650 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III
tags: [graph, dfs]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii/

#### Solution
This is almost the same problem as **1257**. All we need to do is traverse node `p` until we reach root and then traverse again from `q` and check for the first intersection.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the binary tree.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p, q):
        path = {p}
        while p:
            p = p.parent
            path.add(p)
            
        while q not in path:
            q = q.parent
            
        return q
```
