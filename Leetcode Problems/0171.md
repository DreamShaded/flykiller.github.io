Note, that all depends on the place we have some symbol, for example:
for `s = DACB`:
1. We have symbol `B` on the last place, with stands for `2`
2. We have symbol `C` on the previous place, which stands for `3*26`.
3. We have symbol `A` on the previous place, which stands for `1*26*26`.
4. Finally, we have symbol `D` on the first place, which stands for `4*26*26*26`.
5. What we need to return in this case is `2+3*26+1*26*26+4*26*26*26`.

Note, that is it very similar to base `26` numeral system, but not exactly it, here we do not have zeros. All this can be written as oneliner.

**Complexity**: Time complexity of this oneliner is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is length of string. We need to iterate over all string and use `26**i`. Time complexity can be easily reduced to `O(n)`. Space complexity is `O(n)`, which also can be reduced to `O(1)`. But in this problem `n` is very small: `n<=7`, so it will not make a lot of difference

```python
class Solution:
    def titleToNumber(self, s):
        return sum([(ord(T)-ord("A")+1)*26**i for i,T in enumerate(s[::-1])])
```
