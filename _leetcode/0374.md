title: Leetcode 0374 Guess Number Higher or Lower
tags: [binary search, interactive]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/

#### Solution
Just simulate binary search with `O(log_2 n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space. We can also use ternary search with `O(log_3 n)` complexity.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n):
        beg, end = 1, n
        while beg <= end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            t = guess(mid)
            if t == 0: return mid
            if t == -1: end = mid - 1
            if t == 1:  beg = mid + 1
```
