title: Leetcode 0298. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence
tags: [tree, bfs, dfs]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-longest-consecutive-sequence/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-longest-consecutive-sequence/

#### Solution
Just traverse our tree with dfs (or bfs), where `dfs(node)` is the longest consecutive sequence for given `node`. Each time run dfs for left and right subtrees, and then update result for `node`, so we have postorder traversal here.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$, space complexity is $O(h)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, root):
        self.ans = 0
        
        def dfs(node):
            out = 1
            
            for child in [node.left, node.right]:
                if not child: continue
                cand = dfs(child)
                if child.val == node.val + 1:
                    out = max(cand + 1, out)
            self.ans = max(out, self.ans)
            return out
        
        dfs(root)
        return self.ans
```
