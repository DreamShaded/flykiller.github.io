#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/

#### Solution
There is very smart solution, where we spread the highest 1-bit onto all the lower bits. 

#### Complexity
It is just `5` operations we need to do here.

#### Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findComplement(self, num):
        mask = num
        mask |= mask >> 1
        mask |= mask >> 2
        mask |= mask >> 4
        mask |= mask >> 8
        mask |= mask >> 16
        return num ^ mask
```

#### Remark
Another solutions:

We can just find length of number `k` and subtract number from `2^k-1`.

We can also use `x & (x-1)` trick, and delete ones from the end one by one until we reach power of two (we need to make step if `x & (x-1)` is not equal to zero). When we reached power of two `s`, we evaluate 
`(2s+1) ^ num`. Complexity is `O(q)`, where `q` is number of non-zero bits.
