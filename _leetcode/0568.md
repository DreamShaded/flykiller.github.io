#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-vacation-days/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-vacation-days/

#### Solution
Let us introduce `dp(week, city)` state, where `week` is current week number and `city` is current city we are in. Then we just need to check all cities from which we can reach `city` and return maximum. If we have zero week, we return `days[city][0]` if we can reach `city` from starting city `0` or `-inf` in opposite case. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2k)`, because we have `nk` states and for each we need to do at most `n` iterations. Space complexity is `O(nk)`. We also have `G`, which has inverse edges so we can traverse them fast.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxVacationDays(self, flights, days):
        G = defaultdict(set)
        n, k = len(flights), len(days[0])-1
        for i, j in product(range(n), range(n)):
            if flights[i][j] == 1 or i==j: G[j].add(i)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(week, city):
            if week == 0:  
                return days[city][0] if 0 in G[city] else -float("inf")
            return max([dp(week-1, o) + days[city][week] for o in G[city]])
        
        return max([dp(k, city) for city in range(n)])
```
