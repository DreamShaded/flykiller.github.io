#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Triangle-Triplets/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Triangle-Triplets/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0611. Valid Triangle Number.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        nums, count, n = sorted(nums), 0, len(nums)
        for i in range(2, n):
            left, right = 0, i-1
            while left < right:
                if nums[left] + nums[right] > nums[i]:
                    count += (right - left)
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    left += 1
        return count
```
