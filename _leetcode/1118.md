#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-days-in-a-month/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-days-in-a-month/

#### Solution
The only difficulty we have is how to deal with february: for this we check conditions: if it is divisible by 400, then 100, then 4.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(1)`, space is `O(1)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfDays(self, year, month):
        arr = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
        if year % 400 == 0:
            gap = 1
        elif year % 100 == 0:
            gap = 0
        elif year % 4 == 0:
            gap = 1
        else:
            gap = 0
            
        return arr[month - 1] + gap * (month == 2)
```
