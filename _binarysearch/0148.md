#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/S-Expression-Evaluation/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/S-Expression-Evaluation/

#### Solution
1. First of all, let us create `d` is correspondence between open and closing brackets.
2. `part(i)` function will do the following, if symbol `s[i]` is `-` or digit, we grab this number. If it is brackets, we find closing bracket and evaluate expression inside. What is returned is `value, index of last traversed element.`
3. Now, `dp(i)` will deal with string recursively. First, we create first part, then second, then apply operation. Notice, that we need this `part` function, because we can have cases `(- 123 123)`, `(+ 123 (...))`, `(* (...) 123)`, `(/ (...) (...))`.
4. Also be careful about division.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        def corr(s):
            stack, d = [], {}
            for i, elem in enumerate(s):
                if elem == "(":
                    stack.append(i)
                elif elem == ")":
                    last = stack.pop()
                    d[last] = i
            return d

        def op(x, y, o):
            if o == "-": return x - y
            if o == "+": return x + y
            if o == "/": 
                sgn = -1 if x * y < 0 else 1
                return sgn * (abs(x) // abs(y))
            if o == "*": return x * y

        def part(i):
            if s[i] == "(":
                return (dp(i), d[i] + 1)
            else:
                j = i
                while s[j + 1].isdigit(): j += 1
                return (int(s[i: j+1]), j + 1)

        def dp(i):
            part1, idx = part(i + 3)
            part2, _ = part(idx + 1)
            return op(part1, part2, s[i + 1])

        d = corr(s)
        return dp(0)
```
