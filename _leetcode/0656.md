#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-path/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-path/

#### Solution 1
One of the ways to solve this problem is to use `dp`. Let `dp[i]` be pair: price we need to pay to go from position `i` to the end and next position we need to go from place `i`. Note, that if we want to have lexicographically minimum solution, we need to start from the end. How we can update `dp[i]`: we look all `B` places which can be reached from this place: all of them already calculated and choose the best one. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(Bn)`, space complexity is `O(n)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def cheapestJump(self, A, B):
        result, n, k = [], len(A), 0
        dp = [[float("inf"), -1] for _ in range(n)] 
        dp[-1] = [A[n-1], -1]
        
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if A[i] == -1: continue
            for j in range(i+1, min(i+B+1, n)):
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], [A[i] + dp[j][0], j])
                
        if dp[0][0] == float("inf") or A[-1] == -1: return result
        
        while k != -1:
            result.append(k+1)
            k = dp[k][1]
        return result
```

#### Solution 2
Note, that there is also `O(n)` time complexity solution, which use the idea of problem **0239** Sliding Window Maximum. Actually this problem is almost identical to **1696**. Jump Game VI (and almost as **1425** Constrained Subsequence Sum) with only difference here that we need to reconstruct answer. Another difficulty is that we need to get answer with the smallest lexicographical order and if we do it for `nums`, the answer will be the largetst, not smallest. We can reverse `nums` and start to construct answer from the end.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def cheapestJump(self, nums, k):
        nums = [i if i != -1 else float("inf") for i in nums][::-1]
        deq, back, n = deque([0]), {}, len(nums)

        for i in range(1, n):
            while deq and deq[0] < i - k: deq.popleft()
            back[i] = deq[0]
            nums[i] += nums[deq[0]]   
            while deq and nums[i] <= nums[deq[-1]]: deq.pop()
            deq.append(i)

        if nums[-1] == float("inf"): return []
        
        end, ans = n - 1, [1]

        while end:
            end = back[end]
            ans.append(n - end)
        
        return ans 
```
