#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-skips-to-arrive-at-meeting-on-time/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-skips-to-arrive-at-meeting-on-time/

#### Solution
Let us use `dynamic programming` here with the following states, we have `dp(i, k)`, where:

1. `i` is the number of roads we traversed so far.
2. `j` is number of skips we did.
3. output of this function is minimum arriving time.

Note, that because times can be not-integer, we want to multiply everything by speed `S`, so we will work only with integers from now on. Let us discuss function `dp(i, k)` now:

1. If `k < 0`, it means, we out of skips, we made more skips than it was possible and we need to return infinity.
2. If `i < 0`, it means that we did not traverse any road, so we spend `0` time for this.
3. Finally, there can be two options: we can make skip the break and then we have `dist[i] + dp(i-1, k-1)` time or we do not skip it. If we do not skip break, we need to round up our time to the nearest bigger number divisible by `S`.

#### Complexity
We have `O(n^2)` states with at most `2` transitions from one to others, so time and space complexity is `O(n^2)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minSkips(self, dist, S, H):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, k):
            if k < 0: return float("inf")
            if i < 0: return 0
            return dist[i] + min(dp(i-1, k-1), (dp(i-1, k) + S - 1)//S*S)
        
        if sum(dist) > S*H: return -1
        n = len(dist)
        return next(k for k in range(n+1) if dp(n - 1, k) <= H*S)
```

#### 2 liner
```
class Solution:
    def minSkips(self, D, S, H):
        f = lru_cache(None)(lambda i,k: H*S if k < 0 else 0 if i < 0 else (D[i] + min(f(i-1, k-1), (f(i-1, k) + S - 1)//S*S)))
        return next(k for k in range(len(D)) if f(len(D) - 1, k) <= H*S) if sum(D) <= S*H else -1
