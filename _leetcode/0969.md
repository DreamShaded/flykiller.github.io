title: Leetcode 0969. Pancake Sorting

The idea is the following: first, put pancake with the biggest index on its place, then we never need to move it! Let us go through example:
`[3,2,4,6,5,1]`.

1. We want to put pancake number `6` to the end, we can no do it immediatly, so let us put it to the beginning first: we need to flip first **4** pancakes: `A = [6,4,2,3,5,1]`. On the next step we can flip first **6** pancakes, so we have `A = [1,5,3,2,4,6]`.
2. Now, we want to put pancake number `5` to its place, we first flip first **2** pancakes to have `[5,1,3,2,4,6]` and then first **5**, to have `[4,2,3,1,5,6]`.
3. Similar logic with number `4`, but it is already in the beginning, so one step is enough: we flip first **4** pancakes to have `[1,3,2,4,5,6]`. 
4. Put `3` to its place: flip first **2** to have `[3,1,2,4,5,6]` and then flip first **3** to have `[2,1,3,4,5,6]`.
5. Finally, put `2` on its place, flit first **2**: we have `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`.

So, our filps are the following: **[4,6,2,5,4,2,3,2]**.

**Comlexity**: this is interesting part, we need to compute two types of complexities: classical one and how many flips we make. Note, that we make `O(n)` flips, because at each step we need to make no more than `2`. Now, note, that on each step we make no more than `O(n)` operations, because we need to inverse some part of array. So, overall complexity will be `O(n^2)`. Space complexity is `O(n)` to keep our answer.


```python
class Solution:
    def pancakeSort(self, A):
        result, n = [], len(A)
        for i in range(n,0,-1):
            pl = A.index(i)
            if pl == i-1: continue
            if pl != 0:
                result.append(pl+1)
                A[:pl+1] = A[:pl+1][::-1]
            result.append(i)
            A[:i] = A[:i][::-1]
            
        return result
```
