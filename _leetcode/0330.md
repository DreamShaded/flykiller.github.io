#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/

#### Solution 1
Let as keep all possible numbers we can get as list of intervals, for example `0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 12` is `[[0, 2], [4, 5], [12, 12]]`. Then  when we add new number we can merge our intervals, using idea of Problem **0056**. What numbers we need to add next? We need to add number `3` in our example, the smallest possible number, which are not in our array. 

#### Complexity
Complexity is `O(m * log n)`, where `m <= 10000` is the biggest value of `num`. The idea is that in the beginning we can have not more than `m//2` intervals and then on each iteration number of intervals can not increase (?) or increase not too fast. Also number of iterations can not too big, because it is enough `log n` patches always.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals):
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        merged = []
        
        for interval in intervals:
            if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0] - 1:
                merged.append(interval)
            else:
                merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

        return merged


    def minPatches(self, nums, n):
        ints, patches = [[0,0]], 0
        for num in nums:
            ints = self.merge(ints + [[i+num, j+num] for i,j in ints])

        while ints[0][1] < n:
            ints = self.merge(ints + [[i+ints[0][1]+1, j+ints[0][1]+1] for i,j in ints])
            patches += 1

        return patches
```


#### Solution 2
We can improve this solution, if we upgrade the idea of smallest number which we do not have yet. 

**Example**: `nums = [1, 2, 4, 13, 43]`. We go form the smallest number add them one by one and always keep the possible range of numbers we can get in the form `[0, k]`, that is, it is not union of intervals, but only one interval. Let us go through this example. 

1. We did not choose any numbers yet, so we have interval `[0, 0]`.
2. Are we missing something if we take next number `1`? No, let us take it, now we have interval `[0, 1]`.
3. Are we missing something if we take next number `2`? No, let us take it, now we have interval `[0, 3]`.
4. Are we missing something if we take next number `4`? No, let us take it, now we have interval `[0, 7]`.
5. Are we missing something if we take next number `13`? Yes, we missing! What we need to take next patch equal to `8`. So now, our interval is `[0, 15]`.
6. Our next missing number `16` is more, than next number in array: `13`. So if fact, we can create `[0, 28]`.
7. Our next missing number is `29`, it is less than `43`, so we add `29` as patch. and we have interval `[0, 57]`.

#### Complexity

Complexity of this solution is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minPatches(self, nums, n):
        reach, ans, idx = 0, 0, 0
        
        while reach < n:
            if idx < len(nums) and nums[idx] <= reach + 1:
                reach += nums[idx]
                idx += 1
            else:
                ans += 1
                reach = 2*reach + 1       
                
        return ans
```
