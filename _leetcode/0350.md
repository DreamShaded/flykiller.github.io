#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/

#### Solution
Similar to problem **0349**, but here we can use hash-table with number of occurrences or in python we can use `Counter` function.  The idea is to use intersection of counters, using `&` symbol and then just take each symbol with correct frequency. Then we use `chain(*)` to create list.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n + m)` for time and space where `n` and `m` are sizes of `nums` and `nums2`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1, nums2):
        return chain(*[[i]*j for i, j in (Counter(nums1) & Counter(nums2)).items()])
```

#### Follow-up
If our data is sorted, we can use two pointers approach, complexity will be `O(m+n)` and with additional `O(1)` memory, if we do not consider answer as memory. If one of arrays is much bigger than another, we can use binary search with complexity `O(n log m)`. (note, that BS is quite tricky here, because we need to handle duplicates, we need to find the left-most matching number. Next time we perform binary search, the low should start from previously found index + 1). If `nums2` is stored on disk, then we can put `nums1` into hash table and use chunks of `nums1`. If `nums1` is also big, we need to sort them, using external sort and use two pointers.
