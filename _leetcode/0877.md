#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/

#### Solution 1
Let us `dfs(i, j)` be the maximum difference Alex can gain if he plays optimally for piles `i ... j`. There there will be two options: player can take pile `i` or pile `j`. Note, that because turn chances, we need to take gain with minus sign, so we have options `P[i] - dp(i+1, j)` and `P[j] - dp(i, j-1)` and we choose the maximum one.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n^2)`. Space complexity is also `O(n^2)`, which can be reduced to `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def stoneGame(self, P):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j): 
            if i == j: return P[i]
            return max(P[i] - dp(i+1, j), P[j] - dp(i, j-1))
        
        return dp(0, len(P) - 1) > 0
```

#### Solution 2
We can prove that Alex always wins! The idea is that he always can play in such a way that he get all odd piles or all even piles. On the first move he needs to decide what is bigger and play this strategy.

#### Complexity
It is just `O(1)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def stoneGame(self, P):
		return True
```
