Easy problem if you know the trick, but not so easy if you see this type of idea first time. Here we need to use two observations:
1. It is definitely `2` pointers approach, we need to iterate through `nums1` and `nums2` and build solution, using merge.
2. Also, we need to start from **end** of our lists, and this is essential, if you start from the beginning of lists, you can accidentely rewrite you data, so you need to think where to put it first and it will be extra space.

So, all we do is:
1. define `p1 = m - 1` and `p2 = n - 1`: pointers for `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. We start from `i = m + n - 1` and move in backward direction: we compare `nums1[p1]` and `nums2[p2]`, write biggest number to `nums1[i]` and move one of the pointers: `p1` or `p2`.
3. This is not all: it can happen, that when we reached `p1 = 0`, there are still some numbers we need to copy from `nums2` to `nums1`, and in next step we do this.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n + m)`, space complexity is `O(1)`: we did everything inplace.

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
        p1, p2 = m - 1, n - 1
        for i in range(m+n-1, -1, -1):
            if p1 < 0 or p2 < 0: break
            if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:
                nums1[i] = nums1[p1]
                p1 -= 1
            else:
                nums1[i] = nums2[p2]
                p2 -= 1
              
        while p2 >= 0:
            nums1[i] = nums2[p2]
            i -= 1
            p2 -= 1
```
