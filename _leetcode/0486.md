#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/predict-the-winner/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/predict-the-winner/

#### Solution
The simplest way is to use full recursion with `O(2^n)` complexity. Smarter ways are to use dp, where `dp[i][j]` effective score, given numbers from `i` to `j`: maximum difference between first and second players. We can evaluate it as `dp[i,j] = max(nums[i] - dp[i+1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j-1])` and in the end we check if `dp[0][n-1]` is more or equal than `0`.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n^2)`. Space complexity can be reduced to `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def PredictTheWinner(self, nums):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i > j: return 0
            return max(nums[i] - dp(i+1, j), nums[j] - dp(i, j-1))
        
        return dp(0, len(nums) - 1) >= 0
```
