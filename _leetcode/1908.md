#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-nim/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-nim/

#### Solution
Given problem constraints, it is not difficult to do classical dfs. However the is linear time solution, using Spragueâ€“Grundy theorem: if fact all we need to do is to evaluate XOR of all values.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def nimGame(self, piles):
        return reduce(xor, piles) != 0
```
