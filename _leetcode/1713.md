#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-subsequence/

#### Solution
We can see that we need to find in fact the longest common subsequence between two string. Also we need to use the given information that values in `target` is different. This problem can be solved with LIS. First of all we need to rename all values in `target`, so they are increasing. Then we delete all elements from `A` which are not in target and rename others. Then we just need to find LIS.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
from bisect import bisect_left

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, target, arr):
        d = {x:i for i, x in enumerate(target)}
        A = [d[x] for x in arr if x in d]
       
        dp = [10**10] * (len(A) + 1)
        for elem in A: 
            dp[bisect_left(dp, elem)] = elem  
        
        return len(target) - dp.index(10**10)
```
