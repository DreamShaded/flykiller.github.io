#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/split-two-strings-to-make-palindrome/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/split-two-strings-to-make-palindrome/

#### Solution
The idea is if we can construct palindrome from two parts, we need to have the following pattern: imagine we have `abcxyzyz***` and `********cba`, then we have a prefix of the first string is equal to the revesed suffix of the second string. What we have in the middle must be palindrome: it must be palindrome for the first or for the second string. We can have 4 options in total:

1. prefix of `a`, suffix of `b`, middle palindrome of `a`.
2. prefix of `a`, suffix of `b`, middle palindrome of `b`.
3. prefix of `b`, suffix of `a`, middle palindrome of `a`.
4. prefix of `b`, suffix of `a`, middle palindrome of `b`.

Also we need to take care of options when strings are palindromes: then we can have empty strings as partitions.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` both for time and space.

#### Code
```python
from os.path import commonprefix

class Solution:
    def checkPalindromeFormation(self, a, b):
        n = len(a)
        t1 = len(commonprefix([a, b[::-1]]))
        t2 = len(commonprefix([b, a[::-1]]))
        t3 = max(t1, t2)
        if t3*2 >= n: return True
        if a == a[::-1] or b == b[::-1]: return True
        if t3 > 0 and a[t3:-t3] == a[t3:-t3][::-1]: return True
        if t3 > 0 and b[t3:-t3] == b[t3:-t3][::-1]: return True
        return False
```
