#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Rotation-Groups/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Rotation-Groups/

#### Solution
For each string we can find its representative: minimum among all rotations.

#### Complexity
It is `O(l1^2 + ... + ln^2)` for time, where `l1, ..., ln` are lengths of words, space is `O(l1 + ... + ln)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, words):
        d = defaultdict(list)
        for w in words:
            d[min(w[i:] + w[:i] for i in range(len(w)))] += [w]

        return len(d)
```

#### Remark
Notice, that we can find minimum rotation in `O(l)`, which will make total time complexity `O(l1 + ... + ln)`.
