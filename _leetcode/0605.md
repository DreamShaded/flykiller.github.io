Let us consider several cases and underatand, what is going on:
1. Case, when we have empty cases in the start (or end), like `1..`, `01..`, `001..`, `0001..`, `00001..`, ... We can notice, that if we have `k` zeroes, than we can put no more than `k//2` flowers.
2. Case in the middle, like `..11..`, `..101..`, `..1001..`, `..10001..`, `..100001..`: in this case we can notice, tha we can put no more than `(k-1)//2` flowers in each group.

How to handle this two groups so they work in the same way? Add `0` to the beginning and to the end of our `flowerbed`. Next step is to use `groupby`: which will evaluate lengths of each group. Finally, we choose only `even` element from our list of lengths, for each element evaluate `(i-1)//2` maximum number of flowers we can plant into this group, sum them and check if this number is more or equal to `n`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is also `O(n)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed, n):
        t = [len(list(j)) for i, j in groupby([0] + flowerbed + [0])]
        return sum((i-1)//2 for i in t[0::2]) >= n
```
