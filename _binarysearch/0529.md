#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Binary-Matrix-Leftmost-One/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Binary-Matrix-Leftmost-One/

#### Solution
One way to solve is binary search. However we can do better. Start form the top right corner and move only left or down.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m + n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, M):
        if not M: return -1
        m, n = len(M), len(M[0])
        r, c = 0, n - 1
        ans = -1

        while r < m and c >= 0:
            if M[r][c] == 1:
                ans = c
                c -= 1
            else:
                r += 1
        return ans
```
