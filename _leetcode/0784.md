In this problem we need to generate all possible letter case permutations, and let us first underatand how many of them we have. If we have digit, we have only `1` option: we need to choose this digit. If we have letter: we have `2` options: choose either small or capital letter. So, if we have `m` letters, there will be `O(2^m)` different solutions. When you have a lot of different solutions, it is is a good indicator that it is backtracking problem.

So, let us use `dfs(i, built)` function, where:
1. `i` is current number of symbols we are processing and 
2. `built` is string built so far. 

If we have next symbols which is letter, we need to consider two options, if it is digit, only one.

**Complexity** is `O(2^m*k)`, where `m` is number of letters and `k` is length of all string: we have `2^m` solutions, each of them has length `k`, and what is important we never go to deadend, so all solutions we are trying to build will be added to final answer. Space complexity is `O(2^m*k)` as well.

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCasePermutation(self, S):
        def dfs(i, built):
            if i == len(S):
                self.ans.append(built)
                return
            if S[i].isalpha():
                dfs(i+1, built + S[i].lower())
            dfs(i+1, built + S[i].upper())
        
        self.ans = []
        dfs(0, "")
        return self.ans
```

### Solution 2: using product

Another solution is to use `product` functionality from python: complexity is the same but it can work a bit faster do to low-level optimizations.
```python
class Solution:
    def letterCasePermutation(self, S):
        return map(''.join, product(*[set([i.lower(), i.upper()]) for i in S]))
```
