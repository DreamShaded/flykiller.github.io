#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/

#### Solution
In this problem we just need to use the definition of pascal's triangle: to create next row we need to look at previoius row and compute elements. We can do it efficiently using `zip` functionality in python.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` both for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def generate(self, n):
        ans = [[1]]
        for i in range(n-1):
            ans.append([x+y for x,y in zip([0]+ans[-1], ans[-1] + [0])])     
        return ans
```
