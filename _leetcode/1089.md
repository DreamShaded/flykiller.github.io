title: Leetcode 1089. Duplicate Zeros
tags: [array, two pointers]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/

#### Solution
In my opinion quite lengthy problem for easy problem. Idea is to use two pointers. We not allowed to use additional space and we do not know in advance where we finish, so we need to use two passes. On the first pass we find number of zeroes which will be duplicated, that is `dups`. On the second pass go from the end and add zeroes.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr):
        dups, n = 0, len(arr) - 1
        for lft in range(n + 1):
            if lft > n - dups: break
            if arr[lft] == 0:
                if lft == n - dups:
                    arr[n] = 0
                    n -= 1
                    break
                dups += 1
            
        for i in range(n - dups, -1, -1):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                arr[i + dups] = 0
                dups -= 1
                arr[i + dups] = 0
            else:
                arr[i + dups] = arr[i]
```
