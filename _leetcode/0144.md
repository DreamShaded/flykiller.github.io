title: Leetcode 0144 Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
tags: [tree, stack, recursion]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/

#### Solution
Recursive solution is trivial. Alternative is to apply classical dfs, which can be implemented using stack. We add element to output when we remove it from stack.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def preorderTraversal(self, root):
        if not root: return []
        stack, out = [root], []
        while stack:
            cur = stack.pop()
            out.append(cur.val)
            for child in filter(None, [cur.right, cur.left]):
                stack += [child]
        return out
```
