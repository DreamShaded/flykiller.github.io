#### Solution
After evaluating differences like in **0121**, we can just evaluate sum of all positive elements.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space. Space can be made `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, nums):
        diffs = [y - x for x, y in zip(nums, nums[1:])]
        return sum(max(0, x) for x in diffs)
```
