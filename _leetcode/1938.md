#### Problem statement

#### Solution
This solution is inspired by several other solutions I saw here in discussion. The main idea you should ask youself when you see this problem: what to do with XOR? You should look for familiar patterns and the most closest problem here is **421. Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array**. There are different ways to solve this problem and it is very important to understand differend ways so you can extend it for more general cases like we have here.

General idea is the following: we traverse our tree using dfs and each time we update our **trie**, where we keep binary representation of numbers. We need both to insert and to remove elements from trie, because once we finish traverse some node in dfs, we no longer need it. Here I spend some time in python to avoid TLE, and finally we have Trie class as following:

1. We keep embedded dictionary of dictionaries. Key `-1` corresponding for frequency: we need this when we add and delete binary numbers from trie.
2. Also we use knowledge that all `vals` in queries are no bigger than `2*10^5 < 2^18`. so we always will add binary numbers with leading zeroes, for example when we add `11101`, we add `000000000000011101` in fact. Also we update frequencies: increase if we add and decrease if we delete.
3. Now, for `find` it is classical if you already solved **421**: Each time we try to find bit such that XOR of bits is equal to `1` and go to accoridng branch of our trie. If it is not possible, we go to another branch. Note, that some frequencies can be `0`, so we need to make sure that we go only if it is not zero.

Now, let us talk about original funcion:
1. First of all, we need to rearrange queries to defaultdict `Q`: where for each node we keep pair `(index, value)`.
2. Also we create graph from our `parents` nodes.
3. Now, we traverse our tree, using dfs: first insert value when we first visit it, then for each pair `i, val` for this node update `ans`, run function recursively for all children and finally remove value from trie.

#### Complexity
Let `M` be maximum number of bits possible in queries. Then we have time complexity `O((n+q)*M)`, where `n` is size of our tree and `q` is number of queries. Time complexity is `O(n*M)`. In python however it works quite slow, even though I use ints, not strings, I was a bit suprised that it did not make my code faster, anybody have any ideas?

#### Code
```python
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = {-1: 0}

    def insert(self, num, f):
        d = self.root
        for i in range(18, -1, -1):
            bit = (num >> i) & 1
            d = d.setdefault(bit, dict())
            d[-1] = d.get(-1, 0) + f

    def find(self, num):
        node = self.root
        res = 0
        for i in range(18, -1, -1):
            bit = (num >> i) & 1
            desired = 1-bit if 1-bit in node and node[1-bit][-1] > 0 else bit
            res += (desired ^ bit) << i
            node = node[desired]
        return res

class Solution:
    def maxGeneticDifference(self, parents, queries):
        Q, graph = defaultdict(list), defaultdict(list)
        for i, (node, val) in enumerate(queries):
            Q[node].append((i, val))
            
        for i, x in enumerate(parents):
            graph[x].append(i)
        
        ans, trie = [-1 for _ in queries], Trie()
        
        def dfs(node):
            trie.insert(node, 1)
            for i, val in Q[node]: ans[i] = trie.find(val)
            for neib in graph[node]: dfs(neib)
            trie.insert(node, -1)
                
        dfs(graph[-1][0]) 
        return ans
```

#### Solution 2
My trie solution was working not very fast, so I decided to rewrite it, using the following idea: imagine, that we have number `1011`, then we going to add all prefixes to list of Counters: `1` to prefixes of length `0,` `10` to prefixes of length `2` and so on. Then it is easier to update all counters when we add or remove some number. Also the logic to find the maximum exactly the same as previous and `dfs` prat is almost the same.
**UPD** If we use not Counters, but lists then we have more gain in speed, now it is around 5000ms (choose one of two lines where we defined cnts)

1.  `cnts = [Counter() for _ in range(M)]`
2.  `cnts = [[0]*(1<<(M-i)) for i in range(M)]`

#### Complexity
It is the same as previous approach.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxGeneticDifference(self, parents, queries):
        def query(num):
            ans = 0
            for i in range(M-1, -1, -1):
                bit = (num >> i) & 1
                c1, c2 = ans * 2 + (1-bit), ans * 2 + bit
                ans = c1 if cnts[i][c1] > 0 else c2
            return ans ^ num
        
        Q, graph = defaultdict(list), defaultdict(list)
        for i, (node, val) in enumerate(queries):
            Q[node].append((i,val))
            
        for i, x in enumerate(parents):
            graph[x].append(i)
            
        ans, M = [-1 for _ in queries], 18
        cnts = [[0]*(1<<(M-i)) for i in range(M)]
        
        def dfs(node):
            for i in range(M): cnts[i][node>>i] += 1
            for i, val in Q[node]: ans[i] = query(val)
            for neib in graph[node]: dfs(neib)
            for i in range(M): cnts[i][node>>i] -= 1
                
        dfs(graph[-1][0]) 
        return ans
```
