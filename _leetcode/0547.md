#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/

#### Solution
We need to find number of connected components in graph on $n$ nodes. Be careful, it is similar to problem **0200** Number of Islands, but here we have `n` nodes, not `n^2` and what is given here is adjacency matrix. So, just perform any dfs or bfs traversal with `(n^2)` time complexity and `O(n)` space. We can not really do better than `O(n^2)` here, because we need to look at our matrix at least one time.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, M):
        n, comp = len(M), 0
        visited = [0]*n
        
        def dfs(x):
            if visited[x]: return
            visited[x] = 1
            for i in range(n):
                if M[x][i] == 1: dfs(i)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if visited[i] == 0:
                dfs(i)
                comp += 1
        
        return comp
```

#### Remark
There is also Union Find solution with the same complexity.
