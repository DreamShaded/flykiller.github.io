#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/

#### Solution
We can do it with any graph traversal approach, like dfs or bfs in `O(mn)` time complexity: we need to find number of connected components. However in this case we either modify our data or use additional `O(mn)` memory.

We can do it without extra memory, if we use the fact that all ships are `1 x N` or `N x 1`. Traverse our board. If we meet `X`, check all its `4` neighbors. If all `4` are empty, add `1` to number of found ships. If `3` out of four are empty, it means we found end of ship, so we add `0.5` to number of ships.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)`, space is `O(1)`. There is an `2` times improvement, if we check only left and up neighbors.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countBattleships(self, board):
        m, n, ans = len(board), len(board[0]), 0
        for x in range(m):
            for y in range(n):
                if board[x][y] == ".": continue
                neibs = 0
                for dx, dy in (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1):
                    neibs += (0 <= x + dx < m) and (0 <= y + dy < n) and (board[x+dx][y+dy] == "X")
                if neibs == 0: ans += 2
                if neibs == 1: ans += 1
                    
        return ans//2
```
