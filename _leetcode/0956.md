#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/tallest-billboard/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/tallest-billboard/

#### Solution 1
What we need to find is sum of some elements equal to zero, where we can take elements with `0, num, -num` for each number.

First idea is to use the meed in the middle idea, where we split data into two parts and for each part we will keep the following date `(sum of all taken elements, difference between first and second steel supports. To generate all date, we use `dfs(i, j, sm, gain, out)` function, where:

1. `i` is the index of current bar.
2. `j` is the index of last bar we want to take.
3. `f` is sum of all taken elements so far, (this sum can have negative elemens)
4. `s` is the height of the left bar.
5. `out` is the output array, where we keep results.

Then what we do is run `dfs` for left and right parts and then for each `key` in the first dictionary, check if `-key` is in the second dictionary. For these pair we evaluate `d1[key] + d2[-key]` and find the maximum among candidates. 

#### Complexity
It is `O(3^(n//2))` for time and the same for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def tallestBillboard(self, R):
        p1, p2, ans, n = {}, {}, 0, len(R)
    
        def dfs(i, j, f, s, out):
            if i == j:
                out[f] = max(out.get(f, 0), s)
                return
            dfs(i+1, j, f, s, out)
            dfs(i+1, j, f + R[i], s + R[i], out)
            dfs(i+1, j, f - R[i], s, out)
        
        dfs(0, n//2, 0, 0, p1)
        dfs(n//2, n, 0, 0, p2)
        
        for key, val1 in p1.items():
            if -key in p2:
                ans = max(ans, val1 + p2[-key])
                
        return ans
```

#### Solution 2
Similar logic can be applied, but now state is `(i, s)`, where `i` is index of bar, `s` is taken sum (with positive and negative numbers) `dfs(i, s)` answer the question: what is maximum height of the left pillar if we have two pillars with sum `s`. Then we have `3` options:

1. If we do not take bar, we have `dfs(i - 1, s)` option.
2. If we put bar to the right pillar, we have `dfs(i - 1, s - rods[i])`.
3. If we put bar to the left pillar, we have `dfs(i - 1, s + rods[i]) + rods[i]`

#### Complexity
It is `O(s*n)` for time and space, where `s = sum(nums)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def tallestBillboard(self, rods):
        n = len(rods)
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i, s):
            if i == -1:
                return 0 if s == 0 else float("-inf")
            return max(dfs(i - 1, s), dfs(i - 1, s - rods[i]), dfs(i - 1, s + rods[i]) + rods[i])
        
        return dfs(n - 1, 0)
```
