#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/monotone-increasing-digits/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/monotone-increasing-digits/

#### Solution
One way to solve it is greedy approach, where we try to built digit by digit in `O(k^2)` time.

There is smarter solution with `O(k)` time and space complexity: we need to find the first place, when digit is decreasing, for example in number `1123334429`, it will be `11233344`. Then for the last group of repeating digits we need to decrease first one by one and put rest of digits as `9`, so the answer will be `1123333999`. Also we need to check case, when there is not place when digits decrease, then we return original number.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(k)`, where `k` number of digits in `N`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def monotoneIncreasingDigits(self, N):
        prefix, k = ["0"], len(str(N))
        for digit in str(N):
            if digit >= prefix[-1]:
                prefix += [digit]
            else:
                break
        
        if len(prefix) == k + 1: return N
        
        q = prefix.index(prefix[-1])
        return int("".join(prefix[1:q]) + str(int(prefix[q])-1) + "9"*(k-q))
```
