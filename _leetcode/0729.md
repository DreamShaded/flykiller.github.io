#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/

#### Solution
Let us keep sorted list with all `2n` start and end points. For each new interval, perform binary search and check if it has intersections with others. 

#### Complexity
Complexity of one `book` is `O(log n)`, complexity of all algorithm is `O(n log n)`.

#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class MyCalendar:
    def __init__(self):
        self.arr = SortedList()
        
    def book(self, start, end):
        q1 = SortedList.bisect_right(self.arr, start)
        q2 = SortedList.bisect_left(self.arr, end)
        if q1 == q2 and q1 % 2 == 0:
            self.arr.add(start)
            self.arr.add(end)
            return True
        return False
```
