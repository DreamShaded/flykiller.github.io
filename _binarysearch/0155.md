#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Merging-K-Sorted-Lists/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Merging-K-Sorted-Lists/

#### Solution
Variation of Leetcode 0023. Merge k Sorted Lists, but for usual lists, not linked ones.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log k)` for time and `O(n)` for space, where `n` is the total length of all lists.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, lists):
        heap, ans = [], []

        for i in range(len(lists)):
            if lists[i]: heappush(heap, (lists[i][0], i, 0))

        while heap:
            a, i, j = heappop(heap)
            ans += [a]
            if j + 1 < len(lists[i]):
                heappush(heap, (lists[i][j + 1], i, j + 1))
        
        return ans
```
