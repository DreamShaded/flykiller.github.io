tags: [string, counter]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/most-common-word/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/most-common-word/

#### Solution
First of all, let us make all symbols small and remove all punctuation. Then we create set of banned words. Finally, we split our string and for each word if it is not banned, increase counter.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n+m)`, where `n` is length of `paragraph` and `m` is length of all words in `banned`. Space complexity is `O(m+n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph, banned):
        paragraph = ''.join([c.lower() if c.isalpha() else ' ' for c in paragraph])
        words = paragraph.split()
        banned = set(banned)
        cnt = Counter()
        
        for word in words:
            if word not in banned:
                cnt[word] += 1
                
        return cnt.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
