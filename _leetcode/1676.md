#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iv/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iv/

#### Solution
We can solve this problem in almost the same way we solved **0236**. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree. The idea is to use `dfs(node)` function, which return how many nodes from `nodes` is in subtree. To find number of such nodes we need to use postorder dfs, where we look at the left and at the right subtrees first and also at `node` itself. If we see that `lft + rgh + mid == len(nodes)`, we found our node, so we mark `self.Found = node`. Notice that we looking for **LCA**, so if we meet **CA** later, we do not need to save them.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, nodes):
        nodes_set = set(nodes)
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return 0
            lft = dfs(node.left)
            rgh = dfs(node.right)
            mid = node in nodes_set
            if lft + rgh + mid == len(nodes):
                if not self.Found: self.Found = node
            return lft + rgh + mid
        
        self.Found = None
        dfs(root)
        return self.Found
```
