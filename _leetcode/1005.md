#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-sum-of-array-after-k-negations/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-sum-of-array-after-k-negations/

#### Solution
First of all we want to flip as many negative numbers as possible, starting from the smaller one. If we have enough, just flip them. If we have less than `k`, we need to look at reminder `(k - i) % 2`. If it is even number, do nothing, we just flip one number several times. If it is odd, we need to flip `min(A)`, so we subtract it twice from our sum.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def largestSumAfterKNegations(self, A, k):
        A = sorted(A)
        
        i = 0
        while i < len(A) and i < k and A[i] < 0:
            A[i] = -A[i]
            i += 1
        return sum(A) - (k - i) % 2 * min(A) * 2
```
