#### Solution
For each studend keep all scores he has and then sort ids of students and for each student take last `5` elements of sorted scores.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is total number of all scores.
We can use heap as well to keap top 5 marks.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def highFive(self, items):
        d = defaultdict(list)
        for a, b in items:
            d[a] += [b]
        
        return [[a, sum(sorted(d[a])[-5:])//5] for a in sorted(d.keys())]
```
