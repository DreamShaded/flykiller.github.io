#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/convex-polygon/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/convex-polygon/

#### Solution

All we need to do is to make sure, that orientations of all triangles on `3` adjacent nodes are the same. To evaluate orientation of `3` points `(x1; y1), (x2; y2), (x3; y3)` we need to evaluate `(y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2) - (y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)`. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, additional space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isConvex(self, P):
        def ccv(A, B, C):
            return (B[1]-A[1]) * (C[0]-B[0]) - (C[1]-B[1]) * (B[0]-A[0])
        
        ans = [ccv(A, B, C) for A, B, C in zip(P, P[1:]+P, P[2:]+P)]
        return all(i >= 0 for i in ans) or all(i <= 0 for i in ans)
```
