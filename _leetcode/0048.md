#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/

#### Solution
The idea behind if all elements can be divided into groups of `4` and swapped in loops. There are `2` slightly different  cases we need to handle: case of odd `n`, for example:
`1,2,3     ->        7,4,1`

`4,5,6     ->    8,5,2`

`7,8,9     ->    9,6,3`

In this case we need to change groups `1 -> 7 -> 9 - > 3 -> 1`, `2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2` and `5 -> 5`. 

In the case of even `n`, for example:

`05,01,09,11 -> 15,13,02,05`

`02,04,08,10 -> 14,03,04,01`

`13,03,06,07 -> 12,06,08,09`

`15,14,12,16 -> 16,07,10,11`

We need to change `4` groups of numbers `05 -> 15 -> 16 -> 11 -> 05`, `01 -> 13 -> 12 -> 10 -> 01`, `02 -> 14 -> 07 -> 09 -> 02`, `04 -> 03 -> 06 -> 08 -> 04`.

Actually, these two cases can be written in one condition if we carefully choose ranges in which we iterate.

#### Complexity
Time complexity will be `O(n^2)`, space complexity is `O(1)`, because we do not use any additional space.

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, M):
        n = len(M) - 1
        for i in range((n+2)//2):
            for j in range((n+1)//2):
                M[i][j], M[j][n-i], M[n-i][n-j], M[n-j][i] = M[n-j][i], M[i][j], M[j][n-i], M[n-i][n-j]
