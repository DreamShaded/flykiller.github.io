#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Base-3-to-Integer/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Base-3-to-Integer/

#### Solution
Just traverse string and evaluate answer.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time, where `n = len(s)` and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        ans = 0
        for i in s:
            ans = ans * 3 + int(i)
        return ans
```
