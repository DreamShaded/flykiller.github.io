title: Leetcode 0157. Read N Characters Given Read4

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4/

#### Solution
The main difficulty to understand how to use existing function `read4`.

When we run `cnt = read4(buf4)`, then `cnt` will be number of read symbols and they will be written to `buf4` array.
Also we need to change directly `buf` array given to as and in the end return the index in this array where we need to stop.

#### Complexity
It is just $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for time and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for space if we do not count answer.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def read(self, buf, n):
        l, cnt, buf = 0, 4, [''] * 4
        
        while cnt == 4:
            cnt = read4(buf4)
            buf[l:l+cnt] = buf4[:cnt] 
            l += cnt
            
        return min(n, l)
```
