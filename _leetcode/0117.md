title: Leetcode 0117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
tags: []
---

I spend some time for this problem, because my solution for problem **116** is quite different and can not be applied here (https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/discuss/934066/Python-O(n)-time-O(log-n)-space-recursion-explained). So, we need to think of something different here.

The main idea is to go level by level and use already existing `.next` connections: if you will not do it, problem will be quite painful. So, idea is the following:
1. We will keep two nodes: `node` and `curr`: first one is for parent level and `curr` for next level.
2. We check if we have `node.left` and if we have, we create connection `curr.next = node.left` and also move our `curr` to the right, so it always will be the rightest visited node in level.
3. In similar way we check if we have `node.right` and do the same for it.
4. When we finished with `node`, we move it to right: `node = node.next`.
5. Finally, we need to go to the next level: we update `node = dummy.next`.

Note, that in this place we will have some extra connections from dummy variables to left side of our tree, but there is no way testing system can detect it, because it is one-way connections. If you want to be completely honest, you need to add just one more line `dummy.next = None` after the line `node = dummy.next`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`: we visit each node of our tree only once. Space complexity is `O(1)`

```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root):
        node = root
        while node:
            curr = dummy = Node(0)
            while node:
                if node.left:
                    curr.next = node.left
                    curr = curr.next
                if node.right:
                    curr.next = node.right
                    curr = curr.next
                node = node.next
            node = dummy.next
               
        return root
```
