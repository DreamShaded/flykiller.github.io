#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/

#### Solution
Use `dfs(node)` function which returns `True` only if all subtree has only zeroes. Evaluate it for left and right children: if for any of them answer is `True`, we cut this children. Also we return `True` if answer for both child is true and value of node is equal to zero. In the end, we check if answer is `True` and if it is, we return empty tree end if it is not, we return original root. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def pruneTree(self, root):
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return True
            left, right = dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right)
            if left: node.left = None
            if right: node.right = None
            return left and right and node.val == 0
        
        return root if not dfs(root) else None
```
