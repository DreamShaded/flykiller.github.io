#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Rotation-of-Another-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Rotation-of-Another-String/

#### Solution
We can check if length of strings are equal and `s1` in `s0 + s0`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s0, s1):
        return len(s0) == len(s1) and s1 in s0 + s0
```
