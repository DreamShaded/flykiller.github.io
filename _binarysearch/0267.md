#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Mixed-Sorting/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Mixed-Sorting/

#### Solution
Keep odd and even elements + indexes. Then sort and write to hash table. Iterate over hash table and return list.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        d = {}
        odd = [(i, x) for i, x in enumerate(nums) if x % 2 == 1]
        evn = [(i, x) for i, x in enumerate(nums) if x % 2 == 0]
        for i, x in zip([i for i, _ in odd], sorted([x for _, x in odd])[::-1]):
            d[i] = x
        for i, x in zip([i for i, _ in evn], sorted([x for _, x in evn])):
            d[i] = x

        return [d[i] for i in range(len(nums))]
```
