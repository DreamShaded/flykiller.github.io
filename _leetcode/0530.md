tags: [bst, tree, stack]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/

#### Solution
Just use any inorder traversal of tree, either using recursion, or using stack and keep traversed array, which will be increasing. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity as well. Space complexityis `O(h)`, where `h` is height of tree, because we can keep only two last elements each moment of time.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root):
        pre, ans, stack = -float("inf"), float("inf"), []
        while stack or root:
            while root:
                stack.append(root)
                root = root.left
            root = stack.pop()
            pre, ans = root.val, min(ans, root.val - pre)
            root = root.right
            
        return ans
```

#### Remark
Space complexity can be reduced to `O(1)` if we use Morrison traversal.
