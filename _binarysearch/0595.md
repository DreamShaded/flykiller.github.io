#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Subsequence-Match-Target/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Subsequence-Match-Target/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0792. Number of Matching Subsequences.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(m*log n + n)`, because we do at most `m` binary searches and we need `O(n)` to evaluate places. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, words, S):
        def isSubseq(word):
            curr = 0
            for symbol in word:
                ind = bisect_left(places[symbol], curr)
                if ind >= len(places[symbol]):
                    return False
                curr = places[symbol][ind] + 1
            
            return True
        
        places = defaultdict(list)
        for i, symbol in enumerate(S):
            places[symbol].append(i)
        
        return sum(isSubseq(word) for word in words)
```
