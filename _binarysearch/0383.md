#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Factorial-Sum/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Factorial-Sum/

#### Solution
There will be only `12` small enough factorials and we can check all `2^12` sums.

#### Complexity
It is `O(2^k)`, where `k = 12` is total number of different factorials.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        arr = [factorial(x) for x in range(1, 13)]
        sums = set([0])
        for x in arr:
            sums = sums | set([x + i for i in sums])

        return n in sums
```
