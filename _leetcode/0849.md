title: Leetcode 0849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person
tags: []
---

What we need to do in this problem is to find the person with maximum distance to closest person. Imagine, that we have something like:
`000100000111000100001000000`.
Then we need to look at groups of zeroes we have and:
1. For the very left and for the very right groups fo zeroes we need to evaluate size of this groups: for example here we have `3` zeroes for the left group and `6` zeroes for the right group.
2. For the groups of zeroes in the middle, the distance to closest person is (k + 1)//2, where `k` is number of zeroes in this group. For example for group of `5` zeroes we have `1000001`, and the optimal way is to put person in the middle: `1001001`. If we have `4` zeroes: `100001`, we can put person in one of the two places in the middle: `101001` or `100101`.

What we need to do now is just use python `groupby` function and for each group evaluate the optimal position.

**Complexity**: Time complexity is `O(n)` to use groupby, which iterate over our data. Space complexity is also `O(n).

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistToClosest(self, seats):
        out = max(seats[::-1].index(1), seats.index(1))
        for seat, group in groupby(seats):
            if seat: continue
            out = max(out, (len(list(group))+1)//2)

        return out
```
