#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-floored-pairs/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-floored-pairs/

#### Solution
Imagine for the moment that we have `M = 20` and consider number `num = 3`. Then let us look at all numbers divisible by `3` and create array `[0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]` then transform it to accumulate sums:

`acc = [0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6]`

Now, this list has the property that `acc[i] = i//3`

If we have now `m = 5`, then we have `acc = [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4]`. If we sum these two accumulative sums we will have the same result as if we first upate elements for `m = 3` and `m = 5` and then apply accumulate. What we have now in `acc[i] = i//3 + i//5`. So, it is enough to update incs for all elements from nums: better to do it for counters, no need to update each time for `[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5]`, we can do it one time for `3` with frequency `6` and one time for `5` with frequency `3`. Then we traverse acc and choose only those elements we need, not all of them, but only those which we have in nums: here we again can use trick with counter.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(M*log M + n)`, where `n = len(nums)` and `M = max(nums)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sumOfFlooredPairs(self, nums):
        M = max(nums)
        incs, cnt = [0]*(M+1), Counter(nums)           
        for num, freq in cnt.items():                                     
            for j in range(num, M+1, num):               
                incs[j] += freq
        acc = list(accumulate(incs))
        return sum([acc[num]*f for num, f in cnt.items()]) % (10**9 + 7)
```
