In this problem, we need to use **Trie** data structure. For more details go to the problem **208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)**. 

So, what we have here? 
1. `TrieNode` class with two values: dictionary of children and flag, if this node is end of some word.
2. Now, we need to implement `addWord(self, word)` function: we add symbol by symbol, and go deepere and deeper in our Trie. In the end we note our node as end node.
3. Now, about `search(self, word)` function. Here we use `dfs(node, i)` with backtracking, because we can have symbol `.` in our word (here `node` is link to Trie node and `i` is index of letter in `word`). So we need to check all options: we go to all possible children and call `dfs` recursively. If we found not `.`, but just some letter, we check if we have this letter as children, and if we have, we go deeper. If we are out of letters, that is `i == len(word)`, we return `True` if current `end_node` is equal to `1` and false in opposite case. Finally, we return `False` if we can not go deeper, but we still have letters.
4. Now, we just return `dfs(self.root, 0)`.

**Complexity**: Easy part is space complexity, it is `O(M)`, where `M` is sum of lengths of all words in our Trie. This is upper bound: in practice it will be less than `M` and it depends, how much words are intersected. The worst time complexity is also `O(M)`, potentially we can visit all our Trie, if we have pattern like `.....`. For words without `.`, time complexity will be `O(h)`, where `h` is height of Trie. For words with several letters and several `.`, we have something in the middle.

```
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.end_node = 0
        
class WordDictionary:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()      

    def addWord(self, word):
        root = self.root
        for symbol in word:
            root = root.children.setdefault(symbol, TrieNode())
        root.end_node = 1
        
    def search(self, word):
        def dfs(node, i):
            if i == len(word): return node.end_node
               
            if word[i] == ".":
                for child in node.children:
                    if dfs(node.children[child], i+1): return True
                    
            if word[i] in node.children:
                return dfs(node.children[word[i]], i+1)
            
            return False
    
        return dfs(self.root, 0)
```
