#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-number-in-multiplication-table/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-number-in-multiplication-table/

#### Solution
There is bruteforce solution with `O(mn)` complexity, there is Heap solution, using the idea of problem **0373** Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums with complexity `O(k * m log m)`.

Finally, there is Binary Search solution, where for number `x` we asking the question: how many numbers less than `x` we have in table: more or less than `k`.

#### Complexity
We can answer to this question in `O(m)`, so final complexity is `O(m * log(mn)`$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findKthNumber(self, m, n, k):
        def lessEq(x):
            return sum([min(x//i, n) for i in range(1, m+1)]) >= k
        
        beg, end = 1, m*n
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if not lessEq(mid):
                beg = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid
        return beg
```
