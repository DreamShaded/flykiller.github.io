title: Leetcode 0754. Reach a Number

Let us look at several first steps and understand, which numbers we can reach.

1. `n = 1`, numbers we can reach are `-1, 1`
2. `n = 2`, numbers we can reach are `-3, -1, 1, 3`.
3. `n = 3`, numbers we can reach are `-6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6`
4. `n = 4`, numbers we can reach are `-10, -8, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10`
5. `n = 5`, numbers we can reach are `-15, -13, ..., 13, 15`
6. `n = 6`, numbers we can reach are `-21, -19, ..., 19, 21`

What we can notice looking at these numbers are 2  things:
1. We always have continious range either in odd or in even numbers.
2. We have `odd -> even -> even -> odd` period, depending on `n`.  How we can get it? Sum of numbers from `1` to `n` is `n*(n+1)/2` and parity of number depends only on this number and will not change if we replace some of `+` to `-`.

So, we need to find smallest integer. `n`, such that `n*(n+1)/2 >= target`, or `n^2 + n - 2*target >= 0`. This can solved as quadratic equation with solution `bound = ceil(sqrt(2*abs(target)+0.25) - 0.5)`. Also we need to fix odd/even of our number. If we have `bound = 10` for example and even `target`, we need to choose `bound = 11`: smallest bound more or equal to `10`, such that final answer can be even. Similarly we need to check all other cases.

**Complexity**: if we assume that we can take `sqrt` in `O(1)` complexity, then all complexity of algorithm is `O(1)`, both for time and space.

```
class Solution:
    def reachNumber(self, target):
        bound = ceil(sqrt(2*abs(target)+0.25) - 0.5)
        if target % 2 == 0:
            if bound % 4 == 1: bound += 2
            if bound % 4 == 2: bound += 1
        else:
            if bound % 4 == 3: bound += 2
            if bound % 4 == 0: bound += 1
                
        return bound
```
