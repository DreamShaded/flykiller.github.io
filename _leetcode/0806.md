tags: [string]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-lines-to-write-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-lines-to-write-string/

#### Solution
Just iterate symbol by symbol and if we do not have place at some string, go to the next one. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is length of `S`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfLines(self, widths, S):
        x, y = 0, 1
        for symb in S:
            w = widths[ord(symb) - ord("a")]
            if x + w <= 100:
                x += w
            else:
                x, y = w, y + 1
        return [y, x]
```
