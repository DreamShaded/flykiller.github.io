#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-factorization/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-factorization/

#### Solution
We need to factor our number into numbers between `2` and `9`. Also, we need to put big number to the end and small number to the beginning. For example, if our number is divisible by `9`, we need to put `9` to the end, then we put `8`, `7` and so on. Why we do in in this order, because the first digits should be as small as possible.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log^2 a)`, because each time we add to the beginning of string, we can do `O(log a)` if we reverse it in the end. Space complexity is `O(log a)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestFactorization(self, a):
        if a == 1: return 1
        sol = ""
        for i in range(9, 1, -1):
            while a % i == 0:
                sol, a = str(i) + sol, a//i

        if a != 1: return 0

        sol = int(sol)
        return sol if sol < 1<<31 else 0
```
