#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-taps-to-open-to-water-a-garden/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-taps-to-open-to-water-a-garden/

#### Solution
Actually, this problem asks: what is minimum number of intervals needed to cover range `[0, n]`. We can use the greedy strategy: imagine, that we already covered interval `[0, r]`. Then we sort all intervals by their left points and then we look at all intervals which intersect with `[0, r]`, that is which left point is less or equal than $r$ and look for interval with maximum right point. `i` is pointer for current interval. When we checked all intervals which intersect with `[0, r]`, we check if we reached the end or we stuck: `r2 = r` and if we are, return `-1`. If not, increase ans by one and put `r2` equal to `r`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n\log n)$, space complexity is $O(n)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minTaps(self, n, R):
        ints = sorted([(max(0, i-R[i]), min(i+R[i], n)) for i in range(n+1)])
        
        ans, r, i = 0, 0, 0

        while i < n + 1 and r < n:
            r2 = r
            while i < n + 1 and ints[i][0] <= r:
                r2 = max(r2, ints[i][1])
                i += 1
                
            if r2 == r != n: return -1        
            ans, r = ans + 1, r2 
            
        return ans
```

#### Remark
Actually this problem is exactly as **1024**, but with bigger constraints. It is in fact similar to problem **0045** Jump game II
there is $O(n*Q)$ solution, where $Q$ is maximum size of range, which will pass as well.
