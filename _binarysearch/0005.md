#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Palindromic-Integer/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Palindromic-Integer/

#### Solution
Equal to leetcode Leetcode 0009 Palindrome Number

#### Complexity
Time complexity is just `O(n)`, where `n` is length of number, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, x):
        if x < 0 or (x%10 == 0 and x != 0): return False
        
        rev = 0
        while x > rev:
            rev = rev*10 + x%10
            x //= 10

        return x == rev or x == rev//10
```
