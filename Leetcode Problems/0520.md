title: Leetcode 0520. Detect Capital
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0520/
---

We can solve this problem in oneline, if we use python functionality: functions `isupper()` `islower()` and `istitle()`. I think the first two ones are pretty classical and a lot of people aware of them (if not, it is very easy to write this function, just check if symbol is between `a` and `z` for `islower()` and from `A` to `Z` for `isupper()`). Howerer the third one is a bit cheating, so I decided not to use it.

So, we can have three cases. Let us evaluate number of capital letters first:
1. If number of capital letters is equal to `0`, then we return `True`.
2. If number of capital letters is equal to `n` - number of all letters, we also return `True`.
3. If number of capital letters is equal to `1` and first letter is capital, we return `True`.
4. If none of `3` conditions above fulfilled, we return `False`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, because we traverse our string once. Space complexity is `O(1)`, because we have only couple of additional constants.

```
class Solution:
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word):
        Num_cap, n = 0, len(word)
        for letter in word: 
            Num_cap += letter.isupper()
        if Num_cap == 0 or Num_cap == n or Num_cap == 1 and word[0].isupper():
            return True
        return False
```
