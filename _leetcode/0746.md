title: Leetcode 0746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
tags: [array, dp]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/

#### Solution
We can use dp, where we keep only information about two last steps, namely `dp1` and `dp2`  are the minimum costs to reach step before current step and step which is two steps before current step. To update values, we need to update in the same moment two values:
1. `dp1 = dp2`.
2. `dp2 = cost[i] + min(dp1, dp2)`: we can reach it it two ways and we choose the minimum one.

It is very similar to problem **198** House Robber.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost):
        dp1, dp2 = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(cost)):
            dp1, dp2 = dp2, cost[i] + min(dp1, dp2)
            
        return min(dp1, dp2)
```
