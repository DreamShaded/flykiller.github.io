#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Probability-Game/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Probability-Game/

#### Solution
Equal Leetcode 0837 New 21 Game, but check also case, where `K > N`.

#### Complexity
Time is `O(N + W)`, space is `O(W)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, N, K, W):
        if K > N: return 0
        dp = [0] * (N + W + 1)
        for k in range(K, N + 1): dp[k] = 1
        
        S = min((N - K + 1)/W, 1)
        
        for k in range(K - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[k] = S
            S += (dp[k] - dp[k + W])/W

        return dp[0] 
```
