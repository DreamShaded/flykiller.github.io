#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Flight-Itinerary/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Flight-Itinerary/

#### Solution
All we need to do is to find node with indegree 0, this will be start and then traverse all graph.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, flights):
        d1, d2 = {}, {}
        for x, y in flights:
            d1[y] = x
            d2[x] = y

        for x in d2:
            if x not in d1:
                start = x

        path = [start]
        while start in d2:
            start = d2[start]
            path += [start]

        return path
```
