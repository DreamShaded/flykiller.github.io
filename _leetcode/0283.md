tags: [two pointers, array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/

#### Solution
Use two pointers, one is for current place to write number and another goes one by one through all elements.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        beg, end = 0, 0
        while end < len(nums):
            if nums[end] != 0:
                nums[beg], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[beg]
                beg += 1
            end += 1
```
