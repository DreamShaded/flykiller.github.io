#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Toggle-Bitwise-Expression/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Toggle-Bitwise-Expression/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1896. Minimum Cost to Change the Final Value of Expression.

#### Complexity
Time complexity can be estimated as `O(n)`, because in fact for every valid substring we have we will call it once. Space complexity is `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperationsToFlip(self, E):
        def corr(s):
            stack, d = [], {}
            for i, elem in enumerate(s):
                if elem == "(":
                    stack.append(i)
                elif elem == ")":
                    last = stack.pop()
                    d[i] = last
            return d

        def dfs(beg, end):
            if beg == end: return (int(E[beg]) , 1)
            beg2 = d.get(end, end)
            if beg2 == beg: return dfs(beg + 1, end - 1)
            p1, c1 = dfs(beg, beg2 - 2)
            p2, c2 = dfs(beg2, end)
            op = E[beg2 - 1]
            
            t = {"|": lambda x, y:x|y, "&": lambda x, y:x&y}
            c3 = 1 if p1 + p2 == 1 else min(c1, c2) + (p1^(op == "&"))
            return (t[op](p1, p2), c3)
            
        d = corr(E)
        return dfs(0, len(E) - 1)[1]
