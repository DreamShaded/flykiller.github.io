title: Leetcode 0271. Encode and Decode Strings
tags: [string, design]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/

#### Solution
When we encode, put lengths of strings in the beginning of new string with separators and finish it with other separator.  For example `[abc, asdf, sdgsdfg]` will be encoded as `3_4_7#abcasdfsdgsdfg`.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity of both `encode` and `decode` is $O(m)$, where `m` is total lenght of strings/length of encoded string.

#### Code
```python
class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs):
        return "_".join(str(len(s)) for s in strs) + "#" + "".join(strs)
        
    def decode(self, s):
        ind = s.index("#")
        lengths = [int(i) for i in s[:ind].split("_")]
        cumsum = [0] + list(accumulate(lengths))
        return [s[ind+1+x:ind+1+y] for x,y in zip(cumsum, cumsum[1:])]
```
