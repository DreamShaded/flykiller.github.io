#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Turn-Into-Non-Increasing-List/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Turn-Into-Non-Increasing-List/

#### Solution
First of all, the main difficulty that we can have negative numbers in our array, if we have all positive, I think it has linear time solution.
Let `dp[i]` is the the minimum number of operations to make `A[i:]` a non-increasing array. We calcualte it from the end.
To compute `dp[i]`, we greedily find a minimal sub-array `nums[i..j]` such that: `sum(nums[i..j]) > vals[j+1]`, where `vals[j+1]` is the merge value for `dp[j+1]`.


#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        if not A: return 0
        A += [float("-inf")]
        n = len(A)
        dp, vals = [0] * n, A[:]
        for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
            j, x = i, A[i]
            while j < n - 1 and x < vals[j + 1]:
                j += 1
                x += A[j]
            dp[i] = j - i + dp[j + 1]
            vals[i] = x

        return dp[0]
```
