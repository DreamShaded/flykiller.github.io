#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iv/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iv/

#### Solution
A bit strange in my opinion, but not difficult problem: let us create empty full binary tree with `5` levels, then first fill nodes, traversing `nums`. Then use simple dfs to find sum of all paths.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of all algorithm is `O(32)`, because this is number of nodes in our tree.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def pathSumIV(self, nums):
        tree = [[-1],[-1]*2,[-1]*4,[-1]*8, [-1]*16]
        for num in nums:
            dep, pos, val = [int(i) for i in list(str(num))]
            tree[dep-1][pos-1] = val
            
        def dfs(d,w,s):
            if tree[d+1][2*w] == -1 and tree[d+1][2*w+1] == -1:
                self.res += s
            
            for child in [2*w, 2*w+1]:
                if tree[d+1][child] != -1:
                    dfs(d+1, child, s+tree[d+1][child])
                
        self.res = 0
        dfs(0,0,tree[0][0])
        return self.res
```
