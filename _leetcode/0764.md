#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-plus-sign/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-plus-sign/

#### Solution
Classical grid `dp`, where for each cell we need to find biggest number of continuous ones in for directions: up, down, left, right. We need to traverse our grid in `4` different directions and for this I use couple of tricks to make code shorter (notice though that it becomes slower, though complexity is still `O(n^2)`.

1. We create `(N+2)x(N+2)` grid where we add zero padding of size `1` in each direction.
2. To traverse in direct or opposite direction we use `range(1,N+1)[::(-dx>=0)*2-1]`. Notice that if `dx = 1`, we have `1, ..., N+1` and if we have `dx = -1`, then range is `(N+1, ..., 1)`. Similar logic for `dy`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2)`, however with quite big constant: we have `4` directions and also a lot of time spend for creating of empty dp array and finding maximum: so, it is like `O(12n^2)` in all. Space complexity is `O(4n^2)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def orderOfLargestPlusSign(self, N, mines):
        grid = {tuple([x+1, y+1]) for x, y in mines}
        dp = [[[0] * 4 for _ in range(N+2)] for _ in range(N+2)]
        
        for dx, dy, dr in [(-1,0,0),(1,0,1),(0,-1,2),(0,1,3)]:
            for x in range(1,N+1)[::(-dx>=0)*2-1]:
                for y in range(1,N+1)[::(-dy>=0)*2-1]:
                    if (y, x) not in grid:
                        dp[y][x][dr] = dp[y+dy][x+dx][dr] + 1
                                                
        return max(min(q) for p in dp for q in p) 
```
