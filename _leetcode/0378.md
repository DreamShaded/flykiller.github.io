#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/

#### Solution
The idea is for number `X` find number of elements which are less or equal than `X`, which can be done in `O(n)`, idea is similar to problem **240: Search a 2D Matrix II**: we can start with the top right element and move only down and to the left, counting number of elements `<X` in each row. We start with the smallest and the biggest elements in our table and do binary search, each time asking question: is number of elements `< X` is more than `k`? We do binary search and stop when `end` become equal to `beg`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n *  log(A))`, where `A` is difference between maximum and minimum values in our matrix.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix, k):
        n, beg, end = len(matrix), matrix[0][0], matrix[-1][-1]
        
        def check(m):
            i, j, cnt = 0, n-1, 0
            for i in range(n):
                while j >= 0 and matrix[i][j] > m: j -= 1
                cnt += (j + 1)
            return cnt
         
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if check(mid) < k:
                beg = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid
                
        return beg
```

#### Remark
There is also solution, based on the problem **373: Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums**, using heaps with complexity `O(k * log k)`. Depending on matrix it can be bigger or smaller than previous approach.

Finally, there is `O(n)` time complexity algorithm with the idea of median of medians expanded for `2d` matrices, you can find it here https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/discuss/85170/O(n)-from-paper.-Yes-O(rows), It is very difficult but I enjoyed to read it.
