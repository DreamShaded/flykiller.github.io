#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-sort-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-sort-ii/

#### Solution
Find median of all elements, it can be in average in `O(n)` with QuickSelect or in `O(n)` in worst case if we use median of medians. (or `O(n\log n)` if we use sort, which works quite fast).

Use three pointers similar to Problem **0075** about dutch partitioning problem. However here we need to use a bit different indexes, so we can create first so-called `virtal indexes`: correspondence between original and new index.

#### Complexity
If we use proper method for median and do dutch partitiong algorithm like in code, then time complexity will be `O(n)` and space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleSort(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        median = sorted(nums)[n//2]
        def A(i): return (1+2*i) % (n|1)
        
        beg, mid, end = 0, 0, n - 1
        
        while mid <= end:
            if nums[A(mid)] > median:
                nums[A(beg)], nums[A(mid)] = nums[A(mid)], nums[A(beg)]
                beg += 1
                mid += 1
            elif nums[A(mid)] < median:
                nums[A(mid)], nums[A(end)] = nums[A(end)], nums[A(mid)]
                end -= 1
            else:
                mid += 1
```
