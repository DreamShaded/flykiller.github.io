#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Symmetric-Blocks/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Symmetric-Blocks/

#### Solution
First of all array should be in non-increasing order.
We can look at all **angles**: elements, for which `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]`. Then we check that all pairs are symmetric

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        if any(x < y for x, y in zip(nums, nums[1:])): return False
        cands = set()
        for i, x, y in zip(range(1, n+1), nums, nums[1:] + [0]):
            if x != y:
                cands.add((i, x))

        for a, b in cands:
            if (b, a) not in cands: return False
        return True
```

#### Remark
If we want `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space solution, we can use two poitners approach.
