title: BinarySearch 0661 Shortest Distance Between Two Points
tags: [math, geometry, divide and conquer]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Shortest-Distance-Between-Two-Points/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Shortest-Distance-Between-Two-Points/

#### Solution
The idea is to use divide and conquer idea, where we sort points by `x` coordinate and then separate them into two halves. Then we as for answers in both parts and consider possible strip of points in the middle.

#### Complexity
Complexity of given code is `O(n*log^2 n)`, however it can be made `O(n log n)` as well. In fact given constrains and fast python sort function, it works almost the same (if not faster) than true `O(n log n)` solution.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, P):
        def D(P1, P2):
            return (P1[1] - P2[1])**2 + (P1[0] - P2[0])**2

        def dist_BF(beg, end):
            ans = float("inf")
            for i in range(beg, end+1):
                for j in range(i+1, end + 1):
                    ans = min(ans, D(P[i], P[j]))
            return ans

        def dist(beg, end):
            if end - beg <= 3:
                return dist_BF(beg, end)
            
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            dist1 = dist(beg, mid)
            dist2 = dist(mid+1, end)
            dist_min = min(dist1, dist2)
            strip = []
            line = (P[mid][0] + P[mid+1][0]) / 2

            for i in range(beg, end+1):
                if (line - P[i][0])**2 <= dist_min:
                    strip += [P[i]]

            strip.sort(key = lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))
            for i in range(len(strip)):
                for j in range(i + 1, len(strip)):
                    if strip[j][1] - strip[i][1] >= dist_min: break
                    dist_min = min(dist_min, D(strip[i], strip[j]))

            return dist_min

        P = sorted(P)
        return dist(0, len(P) - 1)
