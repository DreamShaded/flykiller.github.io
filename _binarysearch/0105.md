#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Remove-Duplicate-Numbers/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Remove-Duplicate-Numbers/

#### Solution
Let us use counter and then check if frequency is good. I think it is not possible to do it in `O(k)` space and `O(n)` time as hint suggested, because for every number we can not know in advance if we have it more than one time.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        cnt = Counter(nums)
        return [i for i in nums if cnt[i] == 1]
```
