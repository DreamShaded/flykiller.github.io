#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-servers-that-handled-most-number-of-requests/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-servers-that-handled-most-number-of-requests/

#### Solution
The idea is to use two heaps:
1. `aval` is heap for avaliable servers, where we keep id's
2. `busy` is heap of busy servers at the moment, where we keep pair (ending time, id).

When new request arrives, first we need to check all servers which become free: we check `busy[0][0] <= a` for this, then we push this server id to aval. Note, that we want keep in available ids numbers form `i` to `i + k - 1`, so each time we choose from available servers starting from value `i`. Then we extract `j`: index of server we need to allocate to new task and add its ending time to busy heap. Also update `res[j]`. For me tricky part is `i + (x-i)%k` here, alternative way is to keep sortedlist, see next solution.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log k)`, space is `O(k)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def busiestServers(self, k, A, B):
        aval, busy, res = list(range(k)), [], [0]*k 
        for i, (a, b) in enumerate(zip(A, B)):
            while busy and busy[0][0] <= a:
                _, x = heappop(busy)
                heappush(aval, i + (x-i)%k)
            if not aval: continue
                
            j = heappop(aval) % k
            heappush(busy, (a + b, j))
            res[j] += 1
                
        a = max(res)
        return [i for i in range(k) if res[i] == a]
```

#### Solution 2
So, the idea is to keep sorted list of indexes and each time look for smallest element bigger than `i % k`: number of severs we want to start with. If we did not found such element, take `0`-th. 

#### Complexity
Complexity is the same `O(n log k)` for time and `O(k)` for space, but works slower due to heavy sorted list.

#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class Solution:
    def busiestServers(self, k, A, B):
        aval, busy, res = SortedList(range(k)), [], [0]*k
        
        for i, (a, b) in enumerate(zip(A, B)):
            while busy and busy[0][0] <= a:
                _, x = heappop(busy)
                aval.add(x)
            if not aval: continue
                
            idx = aval.bisect_left(i % k) % len(aval)
            act = aval.pop(idx)
            res[act] += 1
            heappush(busy, (a+b, act))
            
        a = max(res)
        return [i for i in range(k) if res[i] == a]
```
