Just traverse tree, using `dfs`, where we keep two values: sum of all tilts of current subtree and sum of nodes in current subtree. Then:

1. If we in `None` node, we return `[0, 0]`: we do nat have any subtree and tilt.
2. Let `t1, s1` be tilt and sum of nodef for left subtree and `t2, s2` for right subtree. Then how we can ealuate final sum of tilts for given node: it is `abs(s1-s2)` plus tilts for its children. To evaluate sum of all values in subtree we just need to evaluate `s1+s2+node.val`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def findTilt(self, root):
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return [0,0]
            t1, s1 = dfs(node.left)
            t2, s2 = dfs(node.right)
            return [t1+t2+abs(s1-s2), s1+s2+node.val]
        return dfs(root)[0]
```
