#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/monotonic-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/monotonic-array/

#### Solution
Just check what is asked in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space. We can do two passes or one pass and do early stopping if needed.

#### Complexity
Time is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isMonotonic(self, A):
        inc = dec = True

        for i in range(len(A) - 1):
            #if not inc and not dec: return False
            if A[i] > A[i+1]: inc = False
            if A[i] < A[i+1]: dec = False

        return inc or dec  
```
