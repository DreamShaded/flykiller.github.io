[string, greedy, binary indexed tree]

Here we have problem about string + swap of elements -> usually it can be solved with BIT. Note that it's useless to swap equal characters (in fact, the string doesn't change and you waste 1 move). Consider each character c from 'a' to 'z' separately. The relative order of a subsequence of equal characters doesn't change in the optimal solution. Hence, the i-th leftmost occurrence of c in the initial string should move to the i-th leftmost occurrence of c in the reversed string. If you number each character of the string, treating equal characters as distinguishable values, you can calculate the array a such that ai is the final position of si in the reversed string, and the result is the number of inversions of a. For example, consider the string `acabcaaababbcb`. The reversed string is `bcbbabaaacbaca`. The positions of `b` in the reversed string are `1, 3, 4, 6, 11`, and this means that `a4 = 1, a9 = 3, ... , a14 = 11` (in fact, `a = [5, 2, 7, 1, 10, 8, 9, 12, 3, 14, 4, 6, 13, 11]`).

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space is `O(n)`.


#### Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class BIT:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.sums = [0] * (n + 1)

    def update(self, i, delta):
        while i < len(self.sums):
            self.sums[i] += delta
            i += i & (-i)

    def query(self, i):
        res = 0
        while i > 0:
            res += self.sums[i]
            i -= i & (-i)
        return res

n = int(input())
s = input().rstrip()

s = [ord(x) - 95 for x in s]
ans, bit = 0, BIT(n)

idx = defaultdict(list)
for i, c in enumerate(s):
    idx[c].append(i)

B = [0] * n
for c, I in idx.items():
    for i in range(len(I)):
        B[I[i]] = (n - I[~i])

for i, b in enumerate(B):
    ans += i - bit.query(b)
    bit.update(b, 1)

print(ans)
