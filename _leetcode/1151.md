#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-group-all-1s-together/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-group-all-1s-together/

#### Solution
The idea is that we need to put all `k` ones to adjacent places. We can try all `n - k + 1` different places and for each of them check how many ones we miss. It can be quickly done with cumulative sums.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(n)` as well to keep cumulative sums.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
     def minSwaps(self, data):
         k, n = sum(data), len(data)
         acc = [0] + list(accumulate(data))
         return k - max(acc[i+k] - acc[i] for i in range(n - k + 1))
```
