#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/print-immutable-linked-list-in-reverse/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/print-immutable-linked-list-in-reverse/

#### Solution
The idea is to use recursion `dfs(node, n)`, where `node` is node we want to start and `n` is number of nodes we want to deal with. For this we can traverse the second half first, then the first one.

#### Complexity
We have recursion `F(n) = 2*F(n/2) + O(n)`, which will lead to `O(n log n)` time complexity. Space complexity is `O(log n)` due to recursion stack.

#### Remark
There is also `O(n)` time and `O(sqrt(n))` space solution, using sqrt decomposition idea: we split everything in `sqrt(n)` blocks of size `sqrt(n)` and save starts of blocks in some list. For each block we can print it in `sqrt(n) time **and** space, using recursion.

In fact this idea can be extended to use double level decompositions and so on.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def printLinkedListInReverse(self, head):
        node, n = head, 0
        while node:
            node = node.getNext()
            n += 1
            
        def dfs(node, n):
            if n == 1: 
                node.printValue()
                return
            mid = node
            for _ in range(n//2): mid = mid.getNext()
            dfs(mid, n-n//2)
            dfs(node, n//2)
            
        dfs(head, n) 
```
