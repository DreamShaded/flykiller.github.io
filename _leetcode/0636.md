#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/

#### Solution
Not very difficult problem once we understand what to do. First thing which was not obvious for me is that our `logs` are already sorted by increasing time. Let us iterate over our logs, parse them and consider `2` cases:

1. `op == "start"`: it means, that we just started new process. In this case we need to check what process we have before started one: we keep this id in the end of our stack. We add passed time to corresponding cell of \texttt{out} result. Also we add new process id to our stack.
2. `op == "end"`: it means that we need to remove one element from stack and also add passed time to corresponding cell of `out`. Note, that we also add `+1`, because of strange statement of this problem: process starts at `0` and ends at `1` spends `2` moments of time.
3. Finally, we update our `last_time`: it is either `time` for start points and `time + 1` for end points.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(m)`, where `m` is number of elements in `logs`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def exclusiveTime(self, N, logs):
        stack, out, last_time = [], [0]*N, 0 
    
        for log in logs:
            ind, op, time = log.split(':')
            ind, time = int(ind), int(time)

            if op == "start":
                if stack:
                    out[stack[-1]] += time - last_time 
                stack += [ind]
            else:
                out[stack.pop()] += time - last_time + 1
                
            last_time = time + (op == "end")

        return out
```
