#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Common-Substring/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Common-Substring/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A, B):
        n, m = len(A), len(B)
        dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if A[i] == B[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]+1
        return max(max(row) for row in dp)
```
