tags: [array, sort, greedy]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i/

#### Solution
It happens that we can just sort numbers and choose every odd number. How we can prove that choosing odd will give the best result? We can show that $S_m = (S - S_d)/2$, where $S_m$ is our sum to maximize and $S_d$ is sum of absolute values between numbers in pairs. So, we need to minimize $S_d$, and we can show our example is optimal.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space complexity is `O(n)` if we are not allowed to change data and `O(log n)` in opposite case.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums):
        return sum(sorted(nums)[::2])
```
