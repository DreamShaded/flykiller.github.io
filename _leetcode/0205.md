title: Leetcode 0205. Isomorphic Strings
tags: [string, hash table]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/

#### Solution
Go symbol by symbol and add direct and inverse connections to hash tables `d1` and `d2`.
1. If `i not in d1` and `j in d2`, it means, that something is wrong, we have case `a -> x`, `b -> x`, return `False`.
2. If `i not in d1` and `j not in d2`, it means that we see this pair first time, update both dictionaries.
3. If `i in d1` and `d1[i] != j`, it means, that we have `a -> x`, `a -> y`, return `False`.
4. In the end return `True` if we did not return anyghing before.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(m)`, where `m` is size of alphabet to keep dictionaries.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s, t):
        d1, d2 = {}, {}
        for i, j in zip(s,t):
            if i not in d1:
                if j in d2: return False
                else:
                    d1[i] = j
                    d2[j] = i
            elif d1[i] != j: return False
            
        return True
```
