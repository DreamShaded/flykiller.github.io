tags: [array, dp]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-3-non-overlapping-subarrays/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-3-non-overlapping-subarrays/

#### Solution
Let us reformulate our problem: evaluate in `O(n)` sums of subarrays of size `k` and call this array `windows`. Let `dp[i][j]` be an answer for the question: what is the maximum sum of `i` non-overlapping windows if we allowed to use only `nums[:j]`. And `index[i][j]` is used for recording for `i`th interval, what are the current start index for first `j` numbers that made up the max sum. In the end we need to backtrack to form solution.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(mn) = O(n)`, because in this problem `m = 3`.

#### Code 1
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSumOfThreeSubarrays(self, nums, k):
        m, n = 3, len(nums)
        dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)] 
        index = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)] 
        
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
        windows = [acc[i+k] - acc[i] for i in range(n-k+1)] 

        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(k - 1, n):
                tmpMax = windows[j+1-k] + dp[i-1][j-k+1]
                if tmpMax > dp[i][j]:
                    dp[i][j+1] = tmpMax
                    index[i][j+1] = j - k + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j+1] = dp[i][j]
                    index[i][j+1] = index[i][j]
                    
        prev, ret = n, []
        for i in range(m, 0, -1):
            ret.append(index[i][prev])
            prev = ret[-1]
            
        return ret[::-1]
```

#### Code 2
It can be written in shorter way (but more difficult to understand) if we combine `dp` and `index` tables in one table of tuples. Also we need to use negative index trick to make sure we choose the smallest index on each step.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSumOfThreeSubarrays(self, nums, k):
        m, n = 3, len(nums)
        dp = [[(0, 0)]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]  
        
        cum_sum = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
        Windows = [cum_sum[i+k] - cum_sum[i] for i in range(n-k+1)] 

        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(k - 1, n):
                tmpMax = Windows[j+1-k] + dp[i-1][j-k+1][0]
                dp[i][j+1] = max((tmpMax, -j + k - 1), dp[i][j])
                  
        prev, ret = n, []
        for i in range(m, 0, -1):
            ret.append(-dp[i][prev][1])
            prev = ret[-1]
            
        return ret[::-1]
```
