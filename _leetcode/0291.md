#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern-ii/

#### Solution
The idea is to use dfs with the following parameters
1. `id_p` is index in pattern `p`
2. `id_s` is index in string `s`
3. `d_ps` is dictionary of connections in the direction `p` $\to$ `s`
3. `d_sp` is dictionary of connections in the direction `s` $\to$ `p`

Next, we use idea of problem **0290** Word Pattern. We take one symbol from `pattern` and check different bijections. 
1. If this letter was not in `d_ps`, then we try to create new connections, take `1, 2, ...` symbols from `s`. Make sure that string `s[id_s:i+1]` not in `d_sp` and then run `dfs` recursively: if at least for one option we have `true`, then return `true`.
2. If this letter was already in `d_ps`, then check that we can continue string `s` and if we can, and anwer for subproblem is `true`, return `true`.
3. If we never returned true, return false in the end.

#### Complexity
Time complexity can be estimated as $O(n \cdot C^{m-1}{n-1})$, space complexity is $O(m + n)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def wordPatternMatch(self, p, s):
        m, n = len(p), len(s)
        
        def dfs(id_p, id_s, d_ps, d_sp):
            if id_s == n and id_p == m: return True
            if id_s == n or  id_p == m: return False

            new_letter = p[id_p]
            if new_letter not in d_ps:
                for i in range(id_s, n):
                    if s[id_s:i+1] not in d_sp:
                        d_ps[new_letter] = s[id_s:i+1]
                        d_sp[s[id_s:i+1]] = new_letter
                        if dfs(id_p + 1, i + 1, d_ps, d_sp): return True
                        d_ps.pop(new_letter)
                        d_sp.pop(s[id_s:i+1])
            else:
                corr = d_ps[new_letter]
                if s[id_s:].startswith(corr):
                    if dfs(id_p + 1, id_s + len(corr), d_ps, d_sp): return True
            
            return False
              
        return dfs(0, 0, {}, {})
```
