#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Prime-Factorization/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Prime-Factorization/

#### Solution
Just check all numbers before square root of `n` and continue with recursion.

#### Complexity
It is `O(sqrt(n))` for time and `O(log^2n)` for space, because we can have `O(log n)` answer, which we extend by one on each iteration.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return [i] + self.solve(n//i)
        return [n]
```
