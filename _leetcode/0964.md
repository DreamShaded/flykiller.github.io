#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/least-operators-to-express-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/least-operators-to-express-number/

#### Solution
Consider say number `287`, which we want to construct using number `5`. Then we need to choose the biggest power of `5`, that is `125` and look at numbers `250` and `375`. Now we have candidates `37` and `88`. We repeat process for those numbers, for `37` we have candidates `12, 13` and for number `88` we also have candidates `13, 12`. Notice, that it will happen always: on each layer we will have no more than `2` candidates. No, we can do it either with recursion or loop, or with `dp(x, target, idx)` is the state where `target` is current target we want to get and `idx` is the biggest power of `x` we deal with now.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log x)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def leastOpsExpressTarget(self, x, target):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(target, idx):
            if idx == 0 or target == 1:
                return target * 2 - 1
            power = x**idx
            cnt = target // power
            low = idx * cnt + dp(target - power * cnt, idx - 1)
            high = idx * (cnt + 1) + dp(power * (cnt + 1) - target, idx - 1)
            return min(low, high)
    
        return dp(target, ceil(log(target, x)))
```
