title: Leetcode 0774 Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station
tags: [binary search, array]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-max-distance-to-gas-station/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-max-distance-to-gas-station/

#### Solution
All we need to do is to use binary search given `mid` value we want to answer the question is number of stations we need to add is more than `K`. How many stations we need to add for each gap: it is `ceil(d/mid) - 1`, that is if say `mid = 3`, then for values `d = 1, 2, 3` we do not need to add new stations, for `d = 4, 5, 6` we need `1` station and so on.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log W)`, space complexity is `O(n)`, where `W` is equal to possible biggest number in `S` (here `10^8`) divided by accuracy we need to get answer (which is `10^{-6}` here).

#### Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def minmaxGasDist(self, S, k):
        diff = [j-i for i, j in zip(S, S[1:])]
        
        beg, end = 0, max(diff)
        while end - beg >= 1e-6:
            mid = (beg + end)/2
            if sum(ceil(d/mid)-1 for d in diff) > k:
                beg = mid
            else:
                end = mid

        return mid
```
