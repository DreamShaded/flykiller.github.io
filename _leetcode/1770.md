#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-performing-multiplication-operations/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-performing-multiplication-operations/

#### Solution
Not very difficult problem, but it is not optimized in python and get TLE withoug tricks. The idea is to use state `dp(i, j, k)` where we consider `nums[i:j+1]` and we have index `k` from multipliers. Notice that `k` is uniquiely defined by `i` and `j`. Also there will be no more than `O(m^2)` states.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(m^2)`, space complexity is the same.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumScore(self, A, M):
        
        @lru_cache(2000)
        def dp(i, j, k):
            if k == len(M) or i > j: return 0
            return max(dp(i+1, j, k+1) + A[i]*M[k], dp(i, j-1, k+1) + A[j]*M[k])
        
        return dp(0, len(A) - 1, 0)
```
