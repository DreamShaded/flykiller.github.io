#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Distinct-Window/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Distinct-Window/

#### Solution
Use counter to keep frequencies of values. Use sliding window where we add and remove elements and update len of counter.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        cnt, n = Counter(nums[:k]), len(nums)
        ans = [len(cnt)]
        for i in range(k, n):
            ans += [ans[-1]]
            cnt[nums[i]] += 1
            if cnt[nums[i]] == 1: ans[-1] += 1
            cnt[nums[i - k]] -= 1
            if cnt[nums[i - k]] == 0: ans[-1] -= 1

        return ans
```
