#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Roomba/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Roomba/

#### Solution
Just check what is asked.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, moves, x, y):
        d = {"NORTH": (0, 1), "SOUTH": (0, -1), "EAST": (1, 0), "WEST": (-1, 0)}
        x0, y0 = 0, 0
        for t in moves:
            dx, dy = d[t]
            x0 += dx
            y0 += dy

        return x == x0 and y == y0
```
