Another classical backtracking problem. Let us try to built our sequence element by element, inserting new element in different places. Imagine, that we have `[1,3,1,2]`. Then our building process will look like:

1. `[1]` on the first step we have not choice, so here we have only one option.
2. Now, we need to insert next element somewhere, and we have two options: before and after, so we have `[1,3]` and `[3,1]` options here.
3. Now we need to insert new element `1`. The problem here is that when we insert it, we can have repeating answers, so the rule is: insert in only before the already existing occurrences of this element. So, in `[1,3]` we can only insert it before `1` and get `[1,1,3]` and in `[3,1]` we have two places to insert and we have `[1,3,1]` and `[3,1,1]`.
4. Finally, we want to insert `2` to the each of existing answers, and we have: `[2,1,1,3]`, `[1,2,1,3]`, `[1,1,2,3]`, `[1,1,3,2]`, `[2,1,3,1]`, `[1,2,3,1]`, `[1,3,2,1]`, `[1,3,1,2]`, `[2,3,1,1]`, `[3,2,1,1]`, `[3,1,2,1]`, `[3,1,1,2]` 

**Complexity**: Time complexity is `O(Q n)`, where `Q` is number of desired permutations and `n` is length of `nums`, because every time we build our sequence we write it in our final answer, that is there will be no dead-ends. `Q` can be evaluated, using multinomial coefficients https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem. Space complexity is the same. 

```python
class Solution:
    def permuteUnique(self, nums):
        def dfs(ind, built):
            if ind == len(nums):
                ans.append(built)
                return

            stop = built.index(nums[ind]) if nums[ind] in built else ind
            
            for i in range(stop+1):
                dfs(ind+1, built[:i]+[nums[ind]]+built[i:])

        ans = []
        dfs(0, [])  
        return ans
```
