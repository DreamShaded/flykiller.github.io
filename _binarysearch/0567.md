#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Contained-Interval/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Contained-Interval/

#### Solution
The ides is to sort intervals by starts and then for ends check if we have some end smaller or equal then next end. Also if we have the same start we sort ends by decrease (or we can return true immedietly).

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, I):
        I = sorted(I, key = lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        for i in range(1, len(I)):
            if I[i][1] <= I[i - 1][1]: return True
        return False
```
