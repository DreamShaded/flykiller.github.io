title: Leetcode 1766 Tree of Coprimes
tags: [tree, dfs, math]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-of-coprimes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-of-coprimes/

#### Solution
Let us do dfs with parameters `(par, node, state)`, where
1. `node` is current node.
2. `par` is parent of current node.
3. `state` is list of `m = max(nums) + 1` numbers, where `state[i]` is closest ancestor which is coprime with `i`.

Each time when we traverse `node`, first we update `ans[node]` and then run dfs recursively for all children: we need to upate all places in `state`, which are coprime with `nums[node]`: for these indexes `state2[i] = node`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*m)`, space is `O(H*m)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def getCoprimes(self, nums, edges):
        n, m = len(nums), max(nums) + 1
        ans = [-1]*n
        G = defaultdict(list)
        for x, y in edges:
            G[x] += [y]
            G[y] += [x]
        
        def dfs(par, node, state):
            ans[node] = state[nums[node]]
            for child in G[node]:
                if child == par: continue
                state2 = state[:]
                for i in range(m):
                    if gcd(i, nums[node]) == 1:
                        state2[i] = node
                dfs(node, child, state2)
            
        
        dfs(-1, 0, [-1]*m)
        return ans
```

### 1617 Count Subtrees With Max Distance Between Cities

[graph, graph algo, dfs, bfs]

#### Solution
Constraints given in problem is quite small: `n <= 15`, so it is possible to check all `2^n` possible subtrees.

1. `dfs(node, mask)` is function to traverse tree, but we can visite only allowed nodes given by `mask`. Here `self.V` is bitmask of already visited nodes. Each time we add node to visited bitmask and then traverse all neighbours. Here I use condition `if not ((~self.V & mask) >> neib) & 1` which check if corresponding bit from `mask` is turned off or if bit from `self.V` is turned on - in this case we can not visit.
2. `diam(node, mask)` is function to find diameter of tree: it will recursively find the two longest paths starting with `node`, update `self.res`: longest path which go through `node` and return longest part from `node` to leaf of tree.
3. Finally, we run `dfs` for every of `2^n` possible bitmasks and if tree is connected: that is visited set is equal to mask, we calculate diamater and increase corresponding element from `ans` by one.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(2^n * n)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countSubgraphsForEachDiameter(self, n, edges):
        G = defaultdict(list)
        ans = [0]*(n-1)
        for x, y in edges:
            G[x-1] += [y-1]
            G[y-1] += [x-1]
        
        def dfs(node, mask):
            self.V |= (1<<node)
            for neib in G[node]:
                if not ((~self.V & mask) >> neib) & 1: continue
                dfs(neib, mask)
                
        def diam(node, mask):
            self.V |= (1<<node)
            maxs = [0, 0]
            for neib in G[node]:
                if not ((~self.V & mask) >> neib) & 1: continue
                depth = diam(neib, mask)
                maxs = sorted(maxs + [depth])[-2:]
            self.res = max(self.res, sum(maxs))
            return maxs[1] + 1
        
        for mask in range(1, 1<<n):
            self.V = 0
            start = mask.bit_length() - 1
            dfs(start, mask)
            if self.V == mask:
                self.V, self.res = 0, 0
                diam(start, mask)
                if self.res > 0: ans[self.res - 1] += 1
        
        return ans
```

#### Solution 2
It is a bit easier to do `O(2^n * n^2)` algorithm which should pass given constraints: we can calcualte distances between each pairs of nodes and then when we look for diameter check `O(n^2)` pairs.

#### Complexity
It is `O(2^n * n^2)` for time and `O(n^2)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countSubgraphsForEachDiameter(self, n, edges):
        g = [[999 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        for [i, j] in edges:
            g[i - 1][j - 1], g[j - 1][i - 1] = 1, 1

        for k, i, j in permutations(range(n), 3):
            g[i][j] = min(g[i][j], g[i][k] + g[k][j])

        ans = [0 for _ in range(n - 1)]
        for k in range(2, n + 1):
            for s in combinations(range(n), k):
                e = sum(g[i][j] for i, j in combinations(s, 2) if g[i][j] == 1)
                d = max(g[i][j] for i, j in combinations(s, 2))
                if e == k - 1:
                    ans[d - 1] += 1
        
        return ans
```
