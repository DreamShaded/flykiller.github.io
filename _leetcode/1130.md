#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-tree-from-leaf-values/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-tree-from-leaf-values/

#### Solution 1
First solution is using dp with states `dp(i, j)` is answer for `arr[i: j + 1]`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^3)` for time and `O(n^2)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def mctFromLeafValues(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        m = {(i, j): max(arr[i:j+1]) for i in range(n) for j in range(i, n)}
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == j: return arr[i]
            return min(dp(i, k) + dp(k + 1, j) + m[i, k]*m[k+1, j] for k in range(i, j))
            
        return dp(0, n - 1) - sum(arr)     
```

#### Solution 2
In fact we can do better, using monotonic stack! The idea is that for each element `arr[i]` we need to find the closest element to the left and closest element to the right which is `>= arr[i]`. Then the answer will be sum of `arr[i] * min(lft[i], rgh[i])`. However it is a good question, why, it is greedy idea, proof TBD. For this we can reuse problem Leetcode 0907 Sum of Subarray Minimums.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def mctFromLeafValues(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        rgh, lft = [float("inf")]*n, [float("inf")]*n

        stack1 = []
        for i in range(n):
            while stack1 and arr[i] >= arr[stack1[-1]]: 
                idx = stack1.pop()
                rgh[idx] = arr[i]
            stack1.append(i)
            
        stack2 = []
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            while stack2 and arr[i] > arr[stack2[-1]]:
                idx = stack2.pop()
                lft[idx] = arr[i]
            stack2.append(i)

        ans = 0
        for x, y, a in zip(lft, rgh, arr):
            if min(x, y) != float("inf"): ans += min(x, y) * a
                
        return ans
```
