#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Number-of-Fractions-that-Sum-to-1/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Number-of-Fractions-that-Sum-to-1/

#### Solution
Use canonical representation for each fraction, then use counter.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log M)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, F):
        cnt = Counter((x//gcd(x, y), y//gcd(x, y)) for x, y in F)
        ans = 0
        for x, y in cnt:
            if (x, y) == (1, 2):
                ans += cnt[x, y] * (cnt[x, y] - 1)
            else:
                ans += cnt[x, y] * cnt[y - x, y]
        return ans//2
```
