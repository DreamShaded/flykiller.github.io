#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Separate-Predators/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Separate-Predators/

#### Solution
We need to find the longest path in graph, we can always go to the parent and use memoisation.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i):
            if A[i] == -1: return 1
            return dfs(A[i]) + 1

        return max(dfs(i) for i in range(len(A)))
```
