#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Equal-Piles/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Equal-Piles/

#### Solution 
Use counter and imagine we have `2, 7, 3, 4` frequencies of elements `1, 2, 3, 4`. Then answer will be `2*0 + 7*1 + 3*2 + 4*3`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        cnt = sorted(list(Counter(nums).items()), key = lambda x: x[0])
        vals = [x for _, x in cnt]
        return sum(i*x for i, x in enumerate(vals))
```
