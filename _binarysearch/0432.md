#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Weird-Clock/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Weird-Clock/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0681 Next Closest Time.

#### Complexity
It is `O(24*60)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, time):
        digits = set(time)
        time = int(time[:2])*60 + int(time[3:])
        for next_time in range(time + 1, time + 60*24 + 1):
            if next_time >= 60*24: next_time -= 60*24
            mins, hours = next_time % 60, next_time // 60
            mins = str(mins + 100)[1:]
            hours = str(hours + 100)[1:]
            time_str = hours + ":" + mins
            if not set(time_str) - digits: return time_str
```
