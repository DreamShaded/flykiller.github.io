#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/group-shifted-strings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/group-shifted-strings?/

#### Solution
For each string, find ooriginalo string, that one which start with `a` (or any other fixed symbol). Keep it in defauldict(list).

#### Complexity
Both time and space complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the sum of all lengths.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def groupStrings(self, strings):
        alph = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        d = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strings:
            q = "".join(alph[(ord(i)-ord(s[0])) % 26] for i in s)
            d[q].append(s)
              
        return d.values()
```
