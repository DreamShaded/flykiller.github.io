#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/

#### Solution
Evaluate cumulative sums and then for each cumulative sum `si` check if we already have `si - k` in our dictionary and how many times. If we do not found it, just increase frequency by one. Be careful, we need to traverse cumulative sums one by one, we can not just evaluate frequencies, in this way we can have both `k` and `-k` subarrays.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums, k):
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
        count = 0
        d = defaultdict(int)
        for i in acc:
            if (i-k) in d:
                count += d[i-k] 
            d[i] += 1
        return count
```
