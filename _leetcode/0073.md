#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/

#### Solution
The idea is to use first row and first column as indicator, if we need to set the whole corresponding column or row to zeros. We also keep `r1 and `c1` variables: do we need to update first column and/or first row in the end. So, we have the following steps:

1. Create `r1` and `c1`.
2. Iterate through our matrix and if we see that for if element `M[i][j]` is equal to `0`, we put both elements `M[i][0]` and `M[0][j]` to `0`.
3. Now, we updated all elements in first row and column, so we iterate our matrix once again: and if we see that one of elements `M[i][0]` or `M[0][j]` equal to `0`, we make `M[i][j] equal to `0`.
4. Finally, we need to update first row and column, so we make them `0`, if we have indicator `r1` for row and `c1` for column.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, M):
        m, n = len(M[0]), len(M)
        r1 = any(M[0][j] == 0 for j in range(m))
        c1 = any(M[i][0] == 0 for i in range(n))
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                if M[i][j] == 0: M[i][0] = M[0][j] = 0
                
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                if M[i][0] * M[0][j] == 0: M[i][j] = 0
                
        if r1:
            for i in range(m): M[0][i] = 0
                
        if c1:
            for j in range(n): M[j][0] = 0
