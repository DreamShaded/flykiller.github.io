#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Uber-Pool/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Uber-Pool/

#### Solution
Sort events and then use line sweep to count how many we have in each moment of time.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, trips, capacity):
        points = [(x, z) for x, y, z in trips]
        points += [(y, -z) for x, y, z in trips]
        total = 0
        for x, gain in sorted(points):
            total += gain
            if total > capacity: return False

        return True
```
