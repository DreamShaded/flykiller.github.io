#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/clumsy-factorial/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/clumsy-factorial/

#### Solution
One possible solution is to notice some pattern and use recursion.
Let us `f(x)` be clumsy factorial, but where the first term is taken with - sign. Then we can evaluate `f(x)` recursively. Then to evaluate clumsy factorial we need to add twice the first term.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def clumsy(self, n):
        def f(x):
            if x <= 4:
                return [0, -1, -2, -6, -5][x]
            else:
                return -(x*(x-1)//(x-2)) + (x-3) + f(x-4)
        
        return f(n) + 2*((n*(n-1))//(n-2)) if n > 4 else [0, 1, 2, 6, 7][n]
```
