tags: [greedy, two pointers]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/

#### Solution
Sort array of greed and array of cookies sizes in ascending order in `O(n log n + m log m)` and then use two iterators to feed children with lowest greed. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n + m log m)`, space complexity is `O(m + n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g, s):
        g, s = sorted(g), sorted(s)
        i, j, ans = 0, 0, 0
        while i < len(g) and j < len(s):
            if g[i] <= s[j]:
                i += 1
                ans += 1
            j += 1
        
        return ans
```
