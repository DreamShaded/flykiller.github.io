#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/

#### Solution
In this problem you just need to sort `nums` and it is not even forbidden to use libraries. So we can just use `sorted(nums)`. 

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sortArray(self, nums):
        return sorted(nums)
```

#### Remark
There are different alternative ways how you can solve this problem, implementing some methods from scratch:

1. Merge sort, using divide and conquer idea
2. Quick sort, similar idea, but less memory
3. Bucket sort if numbers are not too big.
