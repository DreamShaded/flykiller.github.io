How we can add `1` to given number? We need to find the biggest number of `9` in the end of our number, for example for number `5123521999235123999`, there will be three `9` in the end. `512352199923512`**3999**` + 1 = 512352199923512`**4000**: so we need to increase previous symbol by one and change all `9` after to `0`. Now, the steps of algorithm are to following:

1. Let us add one `0` before our data to handle cases like `9`, `99`, `999`, ... 
2. Find maximum number of `9`, starting from the end and moving to the left.
3. Change all found `9` in the end to `0` and previous digit increasy by `1`.
4. Handle border cases: if we have leading zero, remove it.

**Complexity** time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is length of list. Additional space complexity is `O(1)`, because we edit input data directly.

```
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits):
        digits = [0] + digits
        
        end = len(digits) - 1
        while digits[end] == 9:
            end -= 1
    
        digits[end] += 1
        digits[end+1:] = [0] * (len(digits)-1-end)
                   
        return digits if digits[0] != 0 else digits[1:]      
```
