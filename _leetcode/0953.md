#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/

#### Solution
If you solved problem **Alien Dictionary** already, this one will be just copy paste. However if you not, it is still very simple. The idea is to look at pairs of adjacent words and look for first different symbol, for example `hello` and `help` means, that `o` shold go before `p`. Also we need to deal with cases like `hello` and `hell`, where the first one never can go before the second, so we return `False` in this case.

#### Complexity
It is just `O(m)`, where `m` is the total length of all words in `words`.

#### Code
```
class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words, order):
        ord_d = {l:i for i, l in enumerate(order)}
         
        for w1, w2 in zip(words, words[1:]):
            for i, j in zip(w1, w2):
                if i != j:
                    if ord_d[i] > ord_d[j]: return False
                    break
            if w1.startswith(w2) and w1 != w2: return False
            
        return True
