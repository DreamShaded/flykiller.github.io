#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers-sum/

#### Solution
We need to find number of solutions in integer numbers of equation: `a + a+1 + ... + a+k-1 = N`, which can be written as `k(2a+k-1) = 2N`. Notice, that `k < k + 2a - 1` and also these two numbers has different parity. So what we need to find is just number of decomposition of number `2N` into two factors, such that sum of these factors has reminder `1` modulo `2`. It can be written in very simple way.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(sqrt{N})`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def consecutiveNumbersSum(self, N):
        ans = 0
        for k in range(1, ceil(sqrt(2*N))):
            if (k + 2*N/k) % 2 == 1:
                ans += 1
        return ans
```
