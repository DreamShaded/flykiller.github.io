#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/distant-barcodes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/distant-barcodes/

#### Solution
It is almost the same as Leetcode 0767 Reorganize String, heer we do not need to check if answer exists.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n + A log A)`, where `A` is size of dictionary, space is `O(n + A)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def rearrangeBarcodes(self, S):
        cnt, n, Q = Counter(S), len(S), []
        for i, j in sorted(cnt.items(), key = lambda x: -x[1]):
            Q += [i] * j
        d = {i:j for i,j in zip(list(range(n, 2)) + list(range(1, n, 2)), range(n))}
        return [Q[d[i]] for i in range(n)]
```
