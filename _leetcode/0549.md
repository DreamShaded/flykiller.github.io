title: Leetcode 0549 Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence II
tags: [tree, dfs]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-longest-consecutive-sequence-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-longest-consecutive-sequence-ii/

#### Solution
Use helper `dfs` function, which for every node returns two values: length of longest path, starting from this node and going down, which is decreasing monotonic and second value is for increasing monotonic. If we reached `None`, return `(0, 0)`. For every node check it children and update `lengths = [smaller, bigger]` list. Be careful to use `lengths[0] = max(lengths[0], 1 + smaller)`, not just `lengths[0] = 1 + smaller`, because we can have two children with the same value and we need to choose the best one. Also we update `self.maxlen`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`. 

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, root):
        self.maxlen = 1
        def dfs(node):
            lengths = [0, 0]
            for child in filter(None, [node.left, node.right]):
                [smaller, bigger] = dfs(child)
                if child.val == node.val - 1:
                    lengths[0] = max(lengths[0], 1 + smaller)
                elif child.val == node.val + 1:
                    lengths[1] = max(lengths[1], 1 + bigger)
            
            self.maxlen = max(self.maxlen, lengths[0] + lengths[1] + 1)
            return lengths

        dfs(root)
        return self.maxlen
```
