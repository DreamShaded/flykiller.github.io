#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Sublist-of-1s-After-K-Sets/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Sublist-of-1s-After-K-Sets/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        beg, end, zeroes, ans = 0, 0, 0, 0
        while end < len(nums):
            if zeroes + (nums[end] == 0) <= k:
                zeroes += nums[end] == 0
                end += 1
                ans = max(ans, end - beg)
            else:
                zeroes -= nums[beg] == 0
                beg += 1  
        return ans
```
