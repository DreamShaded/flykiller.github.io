tags: [string, greedy]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Shortest-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Shortest-String/

#### Solution
We can notice that as we still have `0` and `1` in string, we have place, where they are adjacent and we can delete them. We stop only if we out of `1` or out of `0`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        return abs(s.count("1") - s.count("0"))
```
