title: Leetcode 2197. Replace Non-Coprime Numbers in Array
tags: [stack, math]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-non-coprime-numbers-in-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-non-coprime-numbers-in-array/

#### Solution
Quite easy problem: all you need to do is to use stack to similate process: put element to stack and while last two elements have `gcd` more then one, extract them and put their `lcm` to stack. Notice, that if we have in problem something about operation with adjacent elements, you should think about stack.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log M)` for time, where `n = len(A)` and `M` is the maximum number, we have log term due to evaluation of `gcd/lcm`. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def replaceNonCoprimes(self, A):
        n, stack = len(A), []
        for x in A:
            stack += [x]
            while len(stack) >= 2 and gcd(stack[-1], stack[-2]) > 1:
                stack += [lcm(stack.pop(), stack.pop())]
        return stack
```
