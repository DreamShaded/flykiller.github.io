In this problem we need to return all posible subsets of given set, and there are a big number of them: `2^n`. It usually means, that we need to use some backtracking approach to do it.
Let us have function `dfs(self, current, nums)`, with parameters:
1. `current` is set of indexes choosen number: we always choose indexes in increasing order. 
2. `nums` are our original numbers (we can make it global varialbe as well).

Also I start with dummy variable index `-1`, and when we add subset to final answer, we remove this element. Then we recursively run `dfs` with new added number `i`.

**Complexity**: both time ans space is `O(2^n*n)`, because we have `2^n` subsets with n/2 elements in average.

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums):
        self.out = []
        self.dfs([-1],nums)
        return self.out

    def dfs(self, current, nums):
        self.out.append([nums[s] for s in current][1:])
        for i in range(current[-1] + 1, len(nums)):
            self.dfs(current + [i], nums)
```

**Oneliners**
First one is to use `combinations` library from python, and we itarate over all possible number of elements. Second one uses binary masks.

```
return chain.from_iterable(combinations(nums, i) for i in range(len(nums)+1))

return [[nums[j] for j in range(len(nums)) if (i&(1<<j))] for i in range(1<<len(nums))]
```
