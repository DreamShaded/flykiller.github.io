title: Leetcode 0322. Coin Change

---

This is classical dynamic programming problem. Let us define state `dp(i)` as the answer to the question: what is the minimum number of coins we need to get value `i`. Then:

1. If `i == 0`, then we need no coins at all, so we return `0`.
2. if `i < 0`, so we are trying to make negative sum, which is not posible, so we return minus infinity as indicator that it is not possible.
3. In other case, we check all `dp(i - coin)` for every coin and add `1` to the result.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(amount * n)`, where `n` is number of coins, because: we have `O(amount)` different states and we have `n` choices to go from any state. Space complexity is the same.

```
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i == 0: return 0
            if i < 0: return float("inf")
            return min(dp(i - coin) + 1 for coin in coins)
        
        return dp(amount) if dp(amount) != float("inf") else -1
```
