#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Maximum-Sums/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Maximum-Sums/

#### Solution
Just evaluate all sums and choose the biggest ones.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2 log n)` for time and `O(n^2)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
        n = len(nums)
        ans = []
        for i in range(n + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                ans += [acc[j] - acc[i]]
        return sorted(ans)[-k:]
```

#### Remark
Using heaps it is possible to do it in `O(n^2 log k)`. Moreover it is possible to make it `O(nk log k)` as well.
