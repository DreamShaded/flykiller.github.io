title: Leetcode 1320. Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers
tags: [dp, string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-to-type-a-word-using-two-fingers/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-to-type-a-word-using-two-fingers/

#### Solution
`dp(f1, f2, ind)` is minimum distance we can have if one finger of `f1`, another on `f2` and we reached index `ind`. Actually we do not need `3` dimension, like in problem **1187** we can look at it at bipartitie graph. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(26*n)`, because on each level we can have at most `26 + 26` states. Space complexity is `O(26)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumDistance(self, word):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dist(x, y):
            return abs(x // 6 - y // 6) + abs(x % 6 - y % 6)
        
        word = [ord(l) - 65 for l in word]
        dp = {(i, j): 0 for i, j in product(range(26), range(26)) if word[0] in (i, j)}
        
        for i, l in enumerate(word):
            dp2 = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
            for f1, f2 in dp:
                dp2[l, f2] = min(dp2[l, f2], dp[f1, f2] + dist(f1, l))
                dp2[f1, l] = min(dp2[f1, l], dp[f1, f2] + dist(f2, l))
            dp = dp2    
        
        return min(dp.values())
```
