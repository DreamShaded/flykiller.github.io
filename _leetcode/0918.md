title: Leetcode 0918 Maximum Sum Circular Subarray
tags: [dp, array]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/

#### Solution
The idea is to use Kadane's algorithm to find maximum sum of usual array - not circular. In fact the can be two cases:
1. Our sum is not include transfer `n-1 -> 0`, then we can use usual Kadane dp.
2. Our sum go from `n-1 -> 0` in some place then we can consider the complementary subarray: such that has all elements which is not included in original one. Then what we need to do is to minimize sum of such array.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubarraySumCircular(self, A):
        if max(A) < 0: return max(A)

        min_el = max_el = dp_max = dp_min = A[0]

        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            dp_max =  A[i] + max(dp_max, 0)
            dp_min =  A[i] + min(dp_min, 0)
            max_el = max(max_el, dp_max)
            min_el = min(min_el, dp_min)

        return max(sum(A) - min_el, max_el)
```
