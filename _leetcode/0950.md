title: Leetcode 0950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order
tags: [array, queue, sort, simulation]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/

#### Solution
We can simulate our process in the reverse order using queue.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for sorting part and `O(n)` for queue, so total `O(n log n)` time and `O(n)` space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def deckRevealedIncreasing(self, deck):
        d = deque()
        for x in sorted(deck)[::-1]:
            d.appendleft(d.pop())   # or use d.rotate()
            d.appendleft(x)
        return list(d)
```
