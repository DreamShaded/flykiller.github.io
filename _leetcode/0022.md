title: Leetcode 0022. Generate Parentheses
tags: [recursion, dp]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/

#### Solution
For each valid parentheses there smallest `k`, for which the first `k` symbols compose well-formed parentheses: `(left)right`. Let us `ans[i]` be all valid parentheses of length `i`. Then we can generate them using recursion. For every `k in range(n+1)` and for every `i in range(k)` we choose left part and right part and append it to final answer. Because we memorize our intermediate results, we can also say that we use dp approach here.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(C_n * n) = O(4^n/n^0.5)`, where `C_n` is Catalan number. Space complexity is the same.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n):
        ans = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
        ans[0] = [""]
        for k in range(n + 1):
            for i in range(k):
                for left in ans[i]:
                    for right in ans[k-i-1]:
                        ans[k].append("(" + left + ")" + right)
        
        return ans[-1]
