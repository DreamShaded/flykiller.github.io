#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Inorder-Successor/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Inorder-Successor/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0285. Inorder Successor in BST

#### Complexity
Time complexity for unbalanced trees can be `O(n)`, for balanced it is just `O(log n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, root, t):
        successor = None
        node = root
                
        while node:
            if node.val <= t:
                node = node.right
            else:
                successor = node.val
                node = node.left
        
        return successor
```
