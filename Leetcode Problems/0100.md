title: Leetcode 0100. Same Tree
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0100/

As it given in problem statement: two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value. So all we need to do is to check this condition recursively:

If we reached node `p` in one tree and `q` in another tree (we allow to reach `None` nodes), we need to consider 3 cases:

1. If one of them do not exist and another exist, we return `False`.
2. If two of them are equal to `None`, we return `True`.
3. If none of two above condition holds, we look at children and return `True` only if values of nodes are equal and if `True` holds for left and right subtrees.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, because we traverse all tree. Space complexity is `O(h)` to keep recursion stack. Time complexity can be imporved a bit, if we use helper function and directly return `False` if we found difference between trees. 

```
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
        if p and not q or q and not p: return False
        if not p and not q: return True
        return p.val == q.val and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```
