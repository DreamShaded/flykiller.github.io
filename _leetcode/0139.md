Let `dfs(k)` be a possibility to split string `s[k:]` into words from `wordSet`. Then to check if word `s[k:]` can be splitted, we need to check if for some `i` word `s[k:i]` in our `wordSet` and if `s[i:]` can be splitted, which is `dfs(i)`.

**Complexity**: let `T` be the maximum length of word in our `wordSet`. Then we need `O(T)` time to check if word in our set, so we have overall `O(n^2T)` complexity. Space complexity is `O(n +Tn)` : to keep our cache and to keep our set of `wordSet`

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s, wordDict):
        wordSet = set(wordDict)
        n = len(s)
   
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(k):
            if k == n: return True
            for i in range(k + 1, n + 1):
                if s[k:i] in wordSet and dfs(i):
                    return True        
            return False
        
        return dfs(0)
```

**Further discussion**: Another approach is to use KMP for each of the `m` words and create `n x n` table `Mem`, where `Mem[i][j]` is equal to `1` if `s[i:j]` is in our dictionary. The complexity to generate `Mem` table is `O(mn)` and `O(n^2)` to update `dp`. Finally, we have `O(n^2 + nm)` time and `O(n^2)` memory.

One more approach is to use Tries to preprocess our dictionary with `O(mk)` time, where `k` is the average length of words. Then we can fill `dp` table in `O(n^2)` time (CHECK, I am not 100 percent sure). Finally, we have `O(mk + n^2)` time and `O(mk)` memory.
