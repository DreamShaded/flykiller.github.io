title: Leetcode 1492. The kth Factor of n
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1492/
---

I do not know why this problem is marked medium: even bruteforce solution will work here fine, because given `n` is small: no more than `10000`. However I prefer more optimal solution: we can check only divisors which are less than square root of `n`: each of them will have pair: for any `d` divisor of `n`, number `n/d` is also divisor of `n`. There is one exception, when `d = n/d` and we do not have pair. Let us find all factors before square root of `n` and put the into list, and also put all divisors which are after square root of `n` to another list. Then we combine these two lists and return element number `k`.

**Complexity**: time and space complexity is `O(sqrt(n))`, because there will be at most `2*sqrt(n)` factors of `n`.

```python
class Solution:
    def kthFactor(self, n, k):
        f1, f2 = [], []
        for s in range(1, int(sqrt(n)) + 1 ):
            if n % s == 0:
                f1 += [s]
                f2 += [n//s]
                
        if f1[-1] == f2[-1]: f2.pop()
            
        factors = f1 + f2[::-1]
        return -1 if len(factors) < k else factors[k-1]
```
