#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/base-7/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/base-7/

#### Solution
Just divide number by seven end evaluate reminder. Also handle negative numbers cases. 

#### Complexity
Complexity is `O(log n)`, both time and space, we need to do this number of divisions.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def convertToBase7(self, num):
        sgn = 1 if num < 0 else 0
        ans, num = "", abs(num)
        while num:
            num, digit = divmod(num, 7)
            ans += str(digit)
            
        return "-"*sgn + ans[::-1] if ans else "0"
```
