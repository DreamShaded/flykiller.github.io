title: Leetcode 1842 Next Palindrome Using Same Digits
tags: [string, permutation, palindrome]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/next-palindrome-using-same-digits/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/next-palindrome-using-same-digits/

#### Solution
The idea is to use **0031** Next Permutation problem. We can consider only half of palindrome and what is asked to find next permutation of given half. It can be done in linear time, then we need to reconstruct palindrome.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def nextPalindrome(self, num):
        n = len(num)
        half = [i for i in num[:n//2]]
        m = len(half)

        i = m - 1
        while i-1 >= 0 and half[i] <= half[i-1]:
            i -= 1
            
        if i == 0: return ""

        j = i
        while j+1 < m and half[j+1] > half[i-1]:
            j += 1

        half[i-1], half[j] = half[j], half[i-1]
        half[i:] = half[i:][::-1]
        
        return "".join(half + [num[n//2]*(n%2 == 1)] + half[::-1])
```
