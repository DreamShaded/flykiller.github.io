title: Leetcode 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1290/
---

What we need to do in this problem is just to understand how binary numbers work. Imagine, that we have number `101100`. Then, it is equal to `1*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0^2^0`.

So what we need to do is just to iterate over our linked list, multiply current `s` by `2` and add value of new element!

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is length of our linked list and space complexity is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head):
        s = 0
        while head:
            s = 2*s + head.val
            head = head.next
        return s
```
