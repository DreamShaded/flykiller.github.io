#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/

#### Solution
Consider the directed graph with edge `x -> y` if `y` is richer than `x`. Then for each person `x`, we want the quietest person in the subtree at `x`. Idea is to use dfs with **post-order** traversal: given node first found answers for all children and find the quietest candidate among answers for children and node itself.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m)` for time and space where `m = len(richer)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def loudAndRich(self, richer, quiet):
        n = len(quiet)
        G = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in richer:
            G[v].append(u)
            
        ans = {}
        def dfs(node):
            if node not in ans:
                ans[node] = min([dfs(child) for child in G[node]] + [node], key = lambda x: quiet[x])
            return ans[node]
        
        return [dfs(i) for i in range(n)]
