title: Leetcode 1277. Count Square Submatrices with All Ones
tags: [dp, 2d-array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/

#### Solution
Use dp, where `dp[i][j]` is number of squares with left upper corner in `(i, j)`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(nm)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countSquares(self, M):
        m, n, ans = len(M[0]), len(M), 0

        dp = [[0]*(m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if M[i][j] == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                ans += dp[i][j]         
        return ans  
```
