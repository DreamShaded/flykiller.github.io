title: Leetcode 1094. Car Pooling

Let us start with example and understand what exactly we are asked to do:
`trips = [[3,2,7],[3,7,9],[8,3,9]], capacity = 11`. Let us represent it in the following way:

`# # 3 3 3 3 3 # # #`
`# # # # # # # 3 3 3`
`# # # 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`

Now, the question is we sum all these lists, where we deal `#` as `0` (`0 0 3 11 11 11 11 11 11 11`) will some number be more than `capacity = 11` or not. Let us instead each list construct another list, such that its cumulative sum is our list:

`0 0 3 0 0 0 0 -3 0 0 0`
`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 -3`
`0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 -8`

Then if we sum these lists and evaluate cumulative sums, we will have exactly what is needed:

`0 0 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 -11 -> cumulative sums -> 0 0 3 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 0`

**Complexity**: time and space complexity is `O(m)`, where `m` is maximum point of time we have.

```
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips, capacity):
        m = max([i for _,_,i in trips])
        times = [0]*(m+2)
        for i,j,k in trips:
            times[j+1] += i
            times[k+1] -= i
        return max(accumulate(times)) <= capacity   
```
