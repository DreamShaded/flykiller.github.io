#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-difference-between-target-and-chosen-elements/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-difference-between-target-and-chosen-elements/

#### Solution
The idea is that our numbers are very small: `mat[i][j] <= 70`, and also `m, n <= 70`. It means, tha final sum of all numbers can be no more than `70**2`.

So, we can do almost bruteforce solution: iterate over rows and keep in `nums` all possible sums we get so far.

#### Complexity
Each time we have in `nums` no more than `70**2` elements and we travere it not more than `70` rows, each of which have no more than `70` elements so final complexity is `O(n^4)`, where `n = 70`. Then we need to find closes element to target which is just `O(n^3)`. Space complexity is `O(n^3)`. It was **AC** during contest for me, however now it gives TLE.

```python
class Solution:
    def minimizeTheDifference(self, mat, target):
        nums = {0}
        for row in mat:
            nums = {x + i for x in row for i in nums}
        
        return min(abs(target - x) for x in nums)
```

#### Solution 2
We can optimize solutoin, taking into account that we need to look around `target`. That is if minimal sum of all numbers is more than target, we do no have choice: we need to take it. In the opposite case no need to go higher than `2*target - possible_min`

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(target * n^2)` now, space is `O(target)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimizeTheDifference(self, mat, target):
        possible_min = sum(min(row) for row in mat)
        if possible_min > target: return possible_min - target
        
        nums = {0}
        for row in mat:
            nums = {x + i for x in row for i in nums if x + i <= 2*target - possible_min}
        
        return min(abs(target - x) for x in nums)
```
