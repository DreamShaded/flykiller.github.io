title: Leetcode 0674 Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence
tags: [array, two pointers, sliding window]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked: use two pointers `beg` and `end`, increase `end` if next number is greater than current; make both `beg` and `end` equal to `end + 1` in opposite case. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums):
        beg, end, ans = 0, 0, int(len(nums) > 0)
        while end < len(nums) - 1:
            if nums[end] < nums[end+1]:
                end += 1
            else:
                beg, end = end + 1, end + 1
            ans = max(ans, end - beg + 1)
        return ans
```
