#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/triples-with-bitwise-and-equal-to-zero/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/triples-with-bitwise-and-equal-to-zero/

#### Solution 1
Let us use the fact than numbers are not very big, that is `< 2^16`. So, we can evaluate `AND` of all pairs in `O(n^2)`. Then we can again evaluate pairs in `O(n * 2^16)`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n * 2^16)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countTriplets(self, A):
        B = Counter(x&y for x, y in product(A, A))
        return sum(B[xy] for z, xy in product(A, B) if xy & z == 0)
```


#### Solution 2
For each element `A[i]` evaluate complementary mask, i.e for `1010010`, mask is `0101101`, then we traverse all submasks and and update `dp`. Then for each pair `i & j` from `A` we check how many values we have.

#### Complexity
It is also `O(n * 2^16)`, but it works several times faster.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countTriplets(self, A):
        n = len(A)
        dp = [0] * (1 << 16)
        for i in range(n):
            state = A[i] ^ ((1 << 16) - 1)
            sub = state
            while sub:
                dp[sub] += 1
                sub = state & (sub - 1)
            dp[0] += 1

        return sum(dp[i & j] for i, j in product(A, A))
```
