#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Short-Circuit/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Short-Circuit/

#### Solution 1
The idea is that we need to construc Eulerian cycle: it is possible to construct it if and only if
1. For each node indegree is equal to outdegree
2. If graph has only one connected component.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(26)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, words):
        def kosaraju(g, n):
            vis, l, comps = [False]*n, [0]*n, [0]*n
            global time
            time, transp = n, [[]] * n

            def visit(u):
                global time
                if vis[u]: return
                vis[u] = True
                for v in g[u]:
                    visit(v)
                    transp[v] = transp[v] + [u]
                time -= 1
                l[time] = u

            def assign(u, root):
                if not vis[u]: return
                vis[u] = False
                comps[u] = root
                for v in transp[u]:
                    assign(v, root)

            for u in range(n): visit(u)
            for u in l: assign(u, u)
            return comps

        letters = set(w[0] for w in words) | set(w[-1] for w in words)
        d = {l:i for i, l in enumerate(letters)}

        G = defaultdict(set)
        G_bal = Counter()
        for w in words:
            G[d[w[0]]].add(d[w[-1]])
            G_bal[w[0]] += 1
            G_bal[w[-1]] -= 1

        if sum(abs(i) for i in G_bal.values()) != 0: return False

        out = kosaraju(G, len(G))
        return out == [0] * len(d)
        
```

#### Solution 2
In fact to check strong connectivity we can use Leetcode 332. Reconstruct Itinerary and Hierholzer's algorithm, which also can return path as well and which will be shorter. 

#### Complexity
Still `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
# not mine code
class Solution:
    def solve(self, words):
        adj = [[] for i in range(128)]
        out, visited, path = [0] * 128, [0] * 128, []
        for w in words:
            s, e = ord(w[0]) - ord("a"), ord(w[-1]) - ord("a")
            adj[s].append(e)
            out[s] += 1
            out[e] -= 1
            visited[s] = visited[e] = 1

        def dfs(start):
            while len(adj[start]) > 0:
                node = adj[start].pop()
                dfs(node)
            path.append(start)
            visited[start] = 0

        dfs(ord(words[0][0]) - ord("a"))
        return path[0] == path[-1] and sum(visited) == 0 and all(out) == 0
```
