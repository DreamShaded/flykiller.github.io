#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways-ii/

#### Solution
Classical dynamic programming problem, where we need to carefully connect `dp_new` with `dp`. There is more clean solution, if we keep `3` states: `dp[0]` is number of total ways,`dp[1]` is number of decodes, ending with `1`, which is not used yet and `dp[2]` is number of decodes, ending with `2`, which is not used yet. Then we can do the following recursion:

1. If `c == "*"` then there can be two options: if last number has only one digit, then we have `9*dp[0]` options. Also, if we try go group last two digits, we have `9*dp[1]` options for `...1*` case and `6*dp[2]` options for `...2*` case. To evaluate new `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, we just return `dp[0]`.
2. If `c != "*"` then total number of options is `(c > '0') * dp[0]` for single digit last number or we could pair it with `1` or with `2` if it is not more than `6`. To evaluate new `dp[1]`, we check if last digit is `1` and for `dp[2]`, we check if last digit is `2`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def numDecodings(self, S):
        mod, dp = 10**9 + 7, [1, 0, 0]
        for c in S:
            dp_new = [0,0,0]
            if c == '*':
                dp_new[0] = 9*dp[0] + 9*dp[1] + 6*dp[2]
                dp_new[1] = dp[0]
                dp_new[2] = dp[0]
            else:
                dp_new[0]  = (c > '0') * dp[0] + dp[1] + (c <= '6') * dp[2]
                dp_new[1]  = (c == '1') * dp[0]
                dp_new[2]  = (c == '2') * dp[0]
            dp = [i % mod for i in dp_new]
        return dp[0]
```

#### Solution 2
Previous solution is very fast and efficient, but I think it is a bit difficult to invent it in short time. So, here is an alternative: let `dp(i)` be the number of ways to decode `s[:i]`. Then we can have several cases:

1. if `i < 0`, we return `1`, there is only one way to decode empty string.
2. if `s[i] == *`, then there is `9*dp(i-1)` ways to decode if we take last number 1-digit. To decode last number 2-digit we need to consider several cases. If we have `1*`, then we have `9` ways to replace `*` with `[1, 2, ..., 9]`. If we have `2*`, then we have `6` ways to replace it with `[1, 2, ..., 6]`. Finally, if we have `**`, then we have `15` options: `[11, ...., 19, 21, ..., 26]`.
3. if `s[i] != *`, that it it is digit, we have `dp(i-1)` ways to decode if we have last digit not equal to `0` and 0 ways if it is zero. For last `2` digits we need again consider cases: if previous element is digit, then only case `[10, ..., 26]` will be good for as, so we add `dp(i-2)`. If we have `*.`, then if `. = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`, then we have `2` options for `*`: 1 and 2, in other case we have only one option.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution: 
    def numDecodings(self, s):
        M = 10**9 + 7 
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i < 0: return 1
            if s[i] == "*":
                corr = {"1": 9, "2": 6, "*":15}
                ans = 9*dp(i-1)
                if i > 0: ans += corr.get(s[i-1], 0)*dp(i-2)
                return ans % M
            
            ans = dp(i-1) if s[i] != "0" else 0
            if i > 0 and "10" <= s[i-1:i+1] <= "26":
                ans += dp(i-2)
            elif i > 0 and s[i-1] == "*":
                ans += (2 if s[i] <= "6" else 1)*dp(i-2)
           
            return ans % M
        
        return dp(len(s)-1) % M
