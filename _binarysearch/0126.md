#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Detect-the-Only-Duplicate-in-a-List/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Detect-the-Only-Duplicate-in-a-List/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0287. Find the Duplicate Number.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        slow, fast = nums[0], nums[0]
        while True:
            slow, fast = nums[slow], nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast: break
           
        slow = nums[0];
        while slow != fast:
            slow, fast = nums[slow], nums[fast]
        return slow
```
