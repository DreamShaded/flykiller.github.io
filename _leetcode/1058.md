#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-rounding-error-to-meet-target/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-rounding-error-to-meet-target/

#### Solution

Let us have numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$. Let us also denote $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ their fraction parts. And by $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ their integer parts. Then we need to have condition $s_1 + \dots + s_n <= target <= s_1 + \dots + s_n + n$ and if it is not holds, return `-1`.

Then we need to evaluate `ceils` is number of values we need to take ceil so in total we have sum `target`. We need to take `target` of them with ceil and `n - ceils = k` of them with floor. So, we need to minimuize 
$q_1 + \dots + q_k + (1-q_{k+1} + \dots + 1 - q_n)$, where $q_i$ is some permutation of $d_i$. It can be rewritten as $q_1 + \dots + q_n + (1-2q_{k+1} + \dots + 1-2q_{n})$. First part is constant, we need to minimize the second one, so we need to take biggest `n-k = ceils` values and ceils of them and take `k` smallest values and take floors of them.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space complexity is `O(n)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimizeError(self, prices, target):
        diff = []
        low, high = 0, 0
        for i, p in enumerate(map(float, prices)):
            f = floor(p)
            low += f
            x = p - f
            high += f + (x!= 0)
            if x != 0:
                diff.append((x, 1-x))

        if not low <= target <= high:
            return "-1"

        diff = sorted(diff)[::-1]
        ceils = target - low
        return "{:.3f}".format(sum([d[1] for d in diff[:ceils]]) + sum([d[0] for d in diff[ceils:]]))

```
