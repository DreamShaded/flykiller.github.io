#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/append-k-integers-with-minimal-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/append-k-integers-with-minimal-sum/

#### Solution
This problem is a bit more difficult that it seems, because we can have `k` very big. So, one of the possible solutions is the following: Let us sort unique values in `A` and start with value `level = k + 1`. For each value in sorted `A`, we check that this value is less then level: if it is, we update answer: add `level` and subtract `x`. Also we start with `k * (k + 1)//2` value: sum of all numbers from `1` to `k`. Imagine example `A = [1, 3, 6, 7, 15]` and `k = 11`. Then we start with elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]` and we have:
1. `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]`: here we removed `1` and added `12`
2. `[2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`: here we removed `3` and added `13`.
3. `[2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`: here we removed `6` and added `14`.
4. `[2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`: here we removed `7` and added `15`.
5. `[2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16]`: here we removed `15` and added `16`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimalKSum(self, A, k):
        level, ans = k + 1, 0
        for x in sorted(set(A)):
            if x < level:
                ans += level - x
                level += 1
        return ans + k * (k + 1)//2
```
