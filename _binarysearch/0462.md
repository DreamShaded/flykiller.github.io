#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Rod-Cutting/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Rod-Cutting/

#### Solution
Let `dp(i)` is the answer to cut rod of length `i`. Then we can use dp to solve it.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, P, n):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i == 0: return 0
            return max(dp(i - k - 1) + P[k] for k in range(i))

        return dp(n)
```
