#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-meals/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-meals/

#### Solution
The idea is that sum is not more than `2^22`, so for each value `dl` we can try to find at most `22` pairs. First we use counters and then we calculate number of options. Also take into account the case of equal values.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*log M)`, where `n = len(D)` and `M = 2^22`. Space complexity is `O(n)` to keep counter.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, D):
        cnt, ans = Counter(D), 0
        
        for dl in cnt:
            for i in range(22):
                if (1<<i) - dl in cnt and dl * 2 < (1<<i):
                    ans += cnt[dl]*cnt[(1<<i) - dl]
            if dl & (dl-1) == 0 and dl > 0:
                ans += cnt[dl]*(cnt[dl] - 1)//2
            
        return ans % (10**9 + 7)
```
