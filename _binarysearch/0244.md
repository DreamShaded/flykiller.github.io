#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Course-Scheduling/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Course-Scheduling/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0207. Course Schedule.

#### Complexity
Time and space is `O(E + V)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, courses):
        def dfs(start):
            if self.FoundCycle == 1: return
            if self.V[start] == 1:
                self.FoundCycle = 1
            if self.V[start] == 0:
                self.V[start] = 1
                for neib in courses[start]:
                    dfs(neib)
                self.V[start] = 2

        n = len(courses)

        self.V = [0] * n
        self.FoundCycle = 0

        for i in range(n):
            if self.FoundCycle == 1: break
            if self.V[i] == 0:
                dfs(i)

        return self.FoundCycle == 0
```
