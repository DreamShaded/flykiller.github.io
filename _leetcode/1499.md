#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/max-value-of-equation/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/max-value-of-equation/

#### Solution
There are different solutions, and the fastest one uses the idea of monotonic deque. What is actually asked in this problem is find `max(yi - xi + (yj + xj))`, where `j > i` and `xj - xi <= k`. The idea is to keep sliding window of points, such that:

1. `while deq and deq[0][0] < x - k: deq.popleft()` In this line we make sure, that we do not have old points, that is if `|x_j - x_i| > k`, we remove this point from left side of or sliding window.
2. `if deq: ans = max(ans, deq[0][1] + x + y)`. In this line we update our answer: in fact we need to find `(yi - xi + (yj + xj))` and if right end of our window `j` is fixed, we need to choose maximum among `yi - xi` in our window.
3. `while deq and y - x >= deq[-1][1]: deq.pop()`: we have always decreasing elements in our deque, by key `(y - x)`, so the biggest element will be the first one, we used it in step `2`.
4. Finally we append key `(x, y - x)` to our deque to the right.

Note, that we can as well just append index i to deque, and then code will be more difficult to read.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxValueOfEquation(self, P, k):
        deq, ans = deque(), -float("inf")
        
        for x, y in P:
            while deq and deq[0][0] < x - k: deq.popleft()  
            if deq: ans = max(ans, deq[0][1] + x + y)
            while deq and y - x >= deq[-1][1]: deq.pop()
            deq.append((x, y-x))
          
        return ans
```

#### Remark
Other ways to solve is heap with lazy updates with complexity `O(n log n)` or sorted list with `O(n log n)` complexity as well.
