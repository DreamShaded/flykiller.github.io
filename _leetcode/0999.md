tags: [2d-array, simulation]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/available-captures-for-rook/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/available-captures-for-rook/

#### Solution
First we need to find rook. Then let us create column and row for rook where we remove all empty cells. Finally, we loook for `Rp` or `pR` substrings in these row and column.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(64)`, space is `O(8)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numRookCaptures(self, B):
        y, x = next((i, j) for j in range(8) for i in range(8) if B[i][j] == 'R')
        row = "".join(B[y][j] for j in range(8) if B[y][j] != ".")
        col = "".join(B[i][x] for i in range(8) if B[i][x] != ".")
        return sum(a in b for a in ('Rp', 'pR') for b in (row, col))
```
