#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Large-to-Small-Sort/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Large-to-Small-Sort/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked, using slices.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        nums = sorted(nums)
        arr = [0] * n
        n1, n2 = len(arr[::2]), len(arr[1::2])
        arr[::2] = nums[::-1][:n1]
        arr[1::2] = nums[:n2]
        return arr

```
