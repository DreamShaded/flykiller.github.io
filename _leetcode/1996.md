#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-weak-characters-in-the-game/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-weak-characters-in-the-game/

#### Solution
This problem is comination of greedy and sort strategies. Let us consider the following example: `[[6, 9], [7, 5], [7, 9], [7, 10], [10, 4], [10, 7]]`.

1. First step is to sort data, in this way we can be sure that for the first value we always have `<= value`. However we are not happy with `=`, we want to take only `<`.
2. So, we split data into groups: `[9], [5, 9, 10], [4, 7]` for the second parameter and process group by group.
3. We keep current `max_y` is the maximum value for the second parameter. In the beginning it is `-1`. When we done with last group, it becomes equal to `7,` then it is equal to `10` and then again `10`.
4. Each time we check condition `q < max_y`. We already sure that for the first parameter we have `<` inequality, by this we check if we are good for the second one.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWeakCharacters(self, X):
        X = sorted(X)
        n = len(X)
        ans, d, max_y = 0, defaultdict(list), -1
 
        for a, b in X:
            d[a] += [b]
            
        for t in sorted(list(d.keys()))[::-1]:
            for q in d[t]:
                if q < max_y: ans += 1
            for q in d[t]:
                max_y = max(max_y, q)
                
        return ans
```
