#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Polyglot-Contest/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Polyglot-Contest/

#### Solution
First of all, number of languages can be upto `32`, so the is not way we can check all masks for languages. So, instead we will check masks for persons. We have state `dp(idx, mask)`, where `idx` is the index of language and `mask` is mask of persons we covered, which know at least one language so-far. Then we have two options:
1. Either add new language to group of languages we choose, then we can update our `mask` as `mask & ~d2[idx]`: here we do difference of sets: `d2[idx]` is mask for persons indexes who know this language. 
2. Or do not add new language.

#### Complexity
It is `O(2^n * l)`, where `n = len(A)` and `l` is total number of languages.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        skills = list(set(chain(*A)))
        d = {s:i for i, s in enumerate(skills)}
        d2 = Counter()  #language: persons
        for i, row in enumerate(A):
            for lang in row:
                d2[d[lang]] += 1<<i

        l, n = len(d2), len(A)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(idx, mask):
            if not mask: return 0
            if idx == l: return float("inf")
            return min(dp(idx + 1, mask), 1 + dp(idx + 1, mask & ~d2[idx]))
            
        return dp(0, (1<<n) - 1)
```
