#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-xor-sum-of-all-pairs-bitwise-and/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-xor-sum-of-all-pairs-bitwise-and/

#### Solution
We can use distribution property of XOR with rescepct to AND and writ is as the following oneliner.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def getXORSum(self, A, B):
        return reduce(xor, A) & reduce(xor, B)
```
