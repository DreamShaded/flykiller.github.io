title: Leetcode 0481 Magical String
tags: [two pointers, string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/magical-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/magical-string/

#### Solution
Actually, this is two pointers problem, where you generate our next data, using previous data. We keep two pointers: slow and fast, where slow is always behind (or equal at the beginning) of fast pointer. We add to the end `1` or `2` numbers, move our fast and slow iterators and change current number. 

#### Complexity
Complexity, both time and space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def magicalString(self, n):
        seq = [1,2,2]
        slow, fast, current = 2, 2, 1
        while fast <= n - 2:
            seq  += [current] * seq[slow]
            fast +=  seq[slow]
            current = 3 - current    
            slow += 1
        return 2*n - sum(seq[:n]) 
```
