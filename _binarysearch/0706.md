#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Smallest-Intersecting-Element/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Smallest-Intersecting-Element/

#### Solution
Just do intersection of sets.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and `O(m)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, M):
        if not M: return -1
        s = set(M[0])
        for row in M[1:]:
            s = s & set(row)
        return min(s) if s else -1
```
