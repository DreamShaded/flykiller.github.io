#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/bomb-enemy/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/bomb-enemy/

#### Solution
There is straightforward $O(mn(m+n))$ solution, where we check full column and row. There is also DP solution, where in `dp[i][j]` we keep 4 numbers: number of enemies will be killed at top, down, left and right, if we put bomb in current cell. Be careful, if we want top, we need to start from bottom row. So, good idea is to add border with walls to our `grid` and then traverse it in $4$ different directions, see Problem **0764**. Largest Plus Sign, where we use similar idea.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(mn)$, space complexity is $O(mn)$ as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxKilledEnemies(self, grid):
        m, n, ans = len(grid), len(grid[0]), 0

        bordered = [["W"] * (n+2) for _ in range(m+2)]
        for i, j in product(range(m), range(n)):
            bordered[i+1][j+1] = grid[i][j]

        dp = [[[0] * 4 for _ in range(n+2)] for _ in range(m+2)]
        
        for dx, dy, dr in [(-1,0,0),(1,0,1),(0,-1,2),(0,1,3)]:
            for x in range(1, m+1)[::(-dx>=0)*2-1]:
                for y in range(1, n+1)[::(-dy>=0)*2-1]:
                    if bordered[x][y] == "W": continue
                    dp[x][y][dr] = dp[x+dx][y+dy][dr] + int(bordered[x][y] == "E")
                    
                    
        for i, j in product(range(1, m+1), range(1, n+1)):
            if bordered[i][j] == "0":
                ans = max(ans, sum(dp[i][j]))

        return ans
```
