title: Leetcode 1413 Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum
tags: [accumulate]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-value-to-get-positive-step-by-step-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-value-to-get-positive-step-by-step-sum/

#### Solution
Nothing special in this problem: we need to compute all prefix sums and then choose the smallest one. Also we need to deal with the case when all sums are positive: we can not start from negative number or zero.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` both for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minStartValue(self, nums):
        return max(1, 1 - min(accumulate(nums)))
```
