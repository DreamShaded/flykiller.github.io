#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-transformed-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-transformed-array/

#### Solution
Similar to Problem **0977**. Squares of a Sorted Array, we can notice that the first half decreasing and second increasing or in the opposite direction. Actually python sort function smart enough to sort data like given in liner time.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$, space complexity is $O(n)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sortTransformedArray(self, nums, a, b, c):
        if a == 0 and b >= 0: return [b*x+c for x in nums]
        if a == 0 and b <  0: return [b*x+c for x in nums[::-1]]
        p1 = [a*x*x+b*x+c for x in nums if x < -b/2/a]
        p2 = [a*x*x+b*x+c for x in nums if x >= -b/2/a]
        if a > 0: return sorted(p1[::-1] + p2)
        if a < 0: return sorted(p2[::-1] + p1)
```
