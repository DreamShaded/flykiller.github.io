#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Bus-Stop/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Bus-Stop/

#### Solution
What is actually we need to find is the longest not-increasing subsequence: we can reverse nums and look for not-decreasing subsequence: we can use classical approach, but change `bisect_left` with `bisect.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        def LIS(nums):
            dp = [10**10] * (len(nums) + 1)
            for elem in nums: dp[bisect.bisect(dp, elem)] = elem  
            return dp.index(10**10)

        return LIS(nums[::-1])
```
