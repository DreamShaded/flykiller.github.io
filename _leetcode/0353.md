#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-snake-game/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/design-snake-game/

#### Solution
Let us keep the following pieces of information:
1. `self.occup` is set of occupied cells by snake.
2. `self.snake` is snake itself in the form of queue.
3. `self.food` is inversed list of food, so we always will look at the last element.
4. `self.dir` is dictionary of directions
5. `self.score` is current score we have.

Then each time we check where new position of head of the snake should be and if it is outside borders, we return `-1`. Also we need to check case of sell-cross, be careful about the case of $4$-elements snake, which will not kill itself: when we arrive at the place of head, tail already not there anymore. Next, we check if new cell has food or not: if it has, then increase score and remove element from `food` list. Else, remove old position of tail from queue and `self.occup`. Finally, add new position to queue and `self.occup`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of `init` is just $O(1)$, as well as for `move` function. Space compplexity is $O(score)$, where `score` is maximum score snake will reach, it is bounded by $W\cdot H$ and $N$: ammount of food as well.

#### Code
```python
class SnakeGame:
    def __init__(self, width, height, food):
        self.w, self.h = width, height
        self.occup = set([(0, 0)])
        self.snake = deque([(0, 0)])
        self.food = food[::-1]
        self.dir = {"D": (0, 1), "U": (0, -1), "R": (1, 0), "L": (-1, 0)}
        self.score = 0      

    def move(self, direction):
        x, y = self.snake[-1]
        dx, dy = self.dir[direction]
        if x+dx < 0 or x+dx >= self.w or y+dy < 0 or y+dy >= self.h:
            return -1
        
        if (x+dx, y+dy) in self.occup and (x+dx, y+dy) != self.snake[0]:
            return -1   
        
        if self.food and self.food[-1] == [y + dy, x + dx]:
            self.score += 1
            self.food.pop()
        else:
            old = self.snake.popleft()
            self.occup.remove(old)
            
        self.snake.append((x+dx, y+dy))
        self.occup.add((x+dx, y+dy))
            
        return self.score
```
