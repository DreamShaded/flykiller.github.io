#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game-ii/

#### Solution
Let us use problem **0293** Flip Game to generate all possible positions. We need to do recursion here: let `is1Win(state)` be a function if first can win, starting with string `state` It is `True`, if we have at least one `False` for possible moves `state_1, ... state_k`. And it is `False`, if for all moves it is `True`.

#### Complexity
To evaluate complexity we need to solve recurrent: $T(n) = T(0)\cdot T(n-2) + T(1)\cdot T(n-3) + \dots T(n-2) \cdot T(0)$, which is similar to Catalan numbers recursion $C_n \approx 4^n / n^{3/2}$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def canWin(self, currentState):
        def moves(state):
            ans, n = [], len(state)
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if state[i:i+2] == "++":
                    ans.append(state[:i] + "--" + state[i+2:])
            return ans
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def is1Win(state):
            for neib in moves(state):
                if not is1Win(neib): return True
            return False
        
        return is1Win(currentState)
```

#### Remark
I think it can be solved in $O(n)$, using Sprague-Grundy theorem.
