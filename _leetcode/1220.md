#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-vowels-permutation/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-vowels-permutation/

#### Solution 1
Let us reformulate problem statement: we can have the following cases:
1. If last letter is `a`, then previous letters can be `e, i, u`
2. If last letter is `e`, then previous letters can be `a, i`
3. If last letter is `i`, then previous letters can be `e, o`
4. If last letter is `o`, then previous letter can be only `i`
5. If last letter is `u`, then previous letters can be `i, o`.

So, we just keep 5 states for letters `a, e, i, o, u` and update it `n-1` times.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countVowelPermutation(self, n):
        a, e, i, o, u, M = 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10**9 + 7
        for _ in range(n-1):
            a, e, i, o, u = (e + i + u)%M, (a + i)%M, (e + o)%M, i%M, (i + o)%M
        
        return (a + e + i + o + u)%M 
```

#### Solution 2
Actually what we have in this problem is linear recurrent and it can be solved using power of matrices. Let `mat` be matrix of possible transitions, then what we need to do is just multiply starting vector `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` by this matrix `n-1` times, or which is equivalent for this problem is sum of elements of matrix `mat^{n-1}`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(m^3*log n) = O(125 * log n)`, where `m` is order of our reccurence. It is `O(log n)` but with quite big constant so I prefer to make this more careful analysis. Space complexity is `O(m^2) = O(25)`.

#### Code
```python
import numpy as np

class Solution:
    def countVowelPermutation(self, n): 
        def power(mat, n, M):
            result = np.eye(len(mat), dtype = int)
            while n > 0:
                if n%2: result = np.dot(mat, result) % M
                mat = np.dot(mat, mat) % M
                n //= 2
            return result
        
        M = 10**9 + 7
        mat = np.matrix([[0,1,0,0,0], [1,0,1,0,0], [1,1,0,1,1], [0,0,1,0,1], [1,0,0,0,0]])      
        return np.sum(power(mat, n-1, M)) % M
