This is in fact graph traversal problem: given `start` position and moving rules, we need to check if we can reach node with value `0`. There are as usual 3 classical approaches how you can do it:

1. bfs, using queue
2. dfs, using stack
3. dfs, using recursion

In this problem, dimensions are not very big, so we can actually choose any of the methods. I chose dfs, using stack, so, what we have here:

`stack` is what we keep for our dfs traversal, `visited` is already visited indexes, so we will not have infinite loop. As usual, we extract element from the top of our `stack`, and if `arr[pos`] equal to zero, we reached our goal and we return True. Then we mark our node as visited and try to make two jumts: forward and backward. We do them only we did not visited these indexes yet.

**Complexity**: Time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is size of our `arr`: we only traverse indexes in this array. Space complexity is `O(n)` as well to keep array of visited nodes (or we can modify `arr`, but I think it is a bit of a cheat).

```python
class Solution:
    def canReach(self, arr, start):
        stack, visited, n = [start], set(), len(arr)
        
        while stack:
            pos = stack.pop()
            if arr[pos] == 0: return True
            visited.add(pos)
            cand1, cand2 = pos + arr[pos], pos - arr[pos]
            if cand1 <  n and cand1 not in visited: stack.append(cand1)
            if cand2 >= 0 and cand2 not in visited: stack.append(cand2)
                
        return False
```
