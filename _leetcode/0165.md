title: Leetcode 0165. Compare Version Numbers

In python it is more like easy than medium problem, there is not a lot of cases we need to handle.

1. First step is to split our strings using `.` and change type from string to int.
2. Now, if we have lists of different length, let us add zeros to the end of short list.
3. Finally, we need to compare `s1` and `s2` as lists. There is not `cmp()` function in python3, but we can use `(s1 > s2) - (s1 < s2)` trick: if `s1 > s2` then we have `1-0 = 1`, if `s1 = s2`, then we have `0-0 = 0`, if we have `s1< s2`, then `0-1 = -1`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n+m)`, where `n` and `m` are lengths of our strings, space complexity `O(n+m)` as well.

```python
class Solution:
    def compareVersion(self, version1, version2):
        s1 = [int(i) for i in version1.split(".")]
        s2 = [int(i) for i in version2.split(".")]
        
        l1, l2 = len(s1), len(s2)
        if l1 < l2: s1 += [0]*(l2-l1) 
        else: s2 += [0]*(l1 - l2)
            
        return (s1 > s2) - (s1 < s2)
```
