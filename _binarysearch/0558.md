#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Flip-to-Zeros/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Flip-to-Zeros/

#### Solution
It all depends on number of groups of adjacent 0/1 we have and we subract 1 if first group is zeroes.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        ans = 0
        for x, y in groupby(nums):
            ans += 1
        if nums and nums[0] == 0: ans -= 1
        return ans
```
