#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Connect-Forest/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Connect-Forest/

#### Solution
The idea is that we have several components and we need to:
1. Find diameter and center of each component. Also find radius of component.
2. Then optimal strategy is to connect centers of these components `c0, c1, ..., c_{k-1}` in the way where `c0` connected with all of the others.
3. How to choose `c0`? We need to sort the radii of components in decreasing order and choose the biggest one for c0 and the rest for others.
4. Then there will be `3` types of pathes: first one is pathes inside components, that is max among `self.diams`. Second type are pathes between central component `c0` and one of the others, we have path of length `r0 + ri + 1` in this case. Finally we have paths between `ci -> c0 -> cj`, then we have `ri + rj + 2` length.

#### Complexity
Time complexity if `O(n log n)`, because we sorted our radii. In fact we do not need to do it, we can just choose the `3` biggest and make it in `O(n)`. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, G): 
        V, n = set(), len(G)
        self.diams = []
        
        def dfs(node):
            V.add(node)
            maxs = [-1, -1]
            for neib in G[node]:
                if neib in V: continue
                depth = dfs(neib)
                maxs = sorted(maxs + [depth])[-2:]
            self.res = max(self.res, sum(maxs) + 2)
            return maxs[1] + 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            self.res = 0
            if i not in V:
                dfs(i)
                self.diams += [self.res]

        if G == [[]]: return 0
        
        k = len(self.diams)
        self.radii = sorted([(i+1)//2 for i in self.diams])[::-1]
        self.ans = max(self.diams)
        if k >= 2: self.ans = max(self.ans, self.radii[0] + self.radii[1] + 1)
        if k >= 3: self.ans = max(self.ans, self.radii[1] + self.radii[2] + 2)

        return self.ans
