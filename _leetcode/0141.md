title: Leetcode 0141. Linked List Cycle

---

This is pretty classical and well-know problem about linked list. One way is just to put all linked list to for example hash table and check if we have repeating elements. However it will take `O(n)` space. There is better solution with only `O(1)` complexity. Imagine the following example:
`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3`, the list with loop. Idea is to use two pointers, one is slow and one is fast, let us do several steps:
1. At the beginning, both of them at number `1`.
2. Next step, slow pointer at `2` and fast at `3`.
3. Next step, slow pointer at `3` and fast at `5`.
4. Next step, slow pointer at `4` and fast at `3`.
5. Next step, slow pointer at `5` and fast is also `5`, so we have the same element and we return `True`.

If we do not have loop we will never have equal elements, if we have loop, because slow pointer moves with speed `1` and fast with speed `2`, fast pointer will always gain slow one.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`. 

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            if slow == fast: return True
            
        return False
```
