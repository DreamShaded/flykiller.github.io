title: Leetcode 1826 Faulty Sensor
tags: [array, two pointers]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/faulty-sensor/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/faulty-sensor/

#### Solution
The idea is to find the biggest common prefix of arrays and then check that the rest parts are shifted by `1`: either in one side or in another. If we see that both options can be true, we return `-1`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def badSensor(self, A1, A2):
        n, found = len(A1), []
        for i in range(n):
            if A1[i] != A2[i]: break
        
        if A1[i:-1] == A2[i+1:]: found += [1]
        if A2[i:-1] == A1[i+1:]: found += [2]
            
        return found[0] if len(found) == 1 else -1
```
