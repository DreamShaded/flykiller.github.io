#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array/

#### Solution
What we need to check is the following: first, that we have only one pair of adjacent elements, such that first is more then the next one. If we found two such elements, we return `False`. If there is not such elements, we return `True`. Also we return `True` if this element is the first or the last. Finally, we return `True` if we can remove this element and have `A[p-1] <= A[p+1]` or remove next element and have `A[p] <= A[p+2]`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkPossibility(self, A):
        p, n = -1, len(A)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if A[i] > A[i+1]:
                if p != -1: return False
                p = i

        return p in [-1, 0, n-2] or A[p-1] <= A[p+1] or A[p] <= A[p+2]
```
