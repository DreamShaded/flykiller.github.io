#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/

#### Solution
Note, that if we have left children and do not have right, than we do not need additional empty brackets. If we have right children we need to call function recursively for both children: and if one of them (left) is empty, then empty brackets will be created automatically.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`, where `h` is height of tree.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def tree2str(self, root):
        if not root: return ""
        s = str(root.val)
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            return s
        if root.left and not root.right:
            return s + "(" + self.tree2str(root.left) + ")"
        return s + "(" + self.tree2str(root.left) + ")(" + self.tree2str(root.right) + ")"
```
