#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/

#### Solution
All we need to do is to run `dfs` (or `bfs`) from all possible starts if node is not visited yet and calculate number of components.

#### Complexity
It is just $O(E+n)$ for time and $O(n)$ for space. If we have used union find with ranks and path compression it would be the same.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n, edges):
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        visited = [0]*n
        for x, y in edges:
            graph[x].append(y)
            graph[y].append(x)
            
        def dfs(node, color):
            visited[node] = color
            for neib in graph[node]:
                if visited[neib] == 0:
                    dfs(neib, color)
        
        col = 1
        for i in range(n):
            if visited[i] == 0:
                dfs(i, col)
                col += 1
            
        return max(visited)
```
