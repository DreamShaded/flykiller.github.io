#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Planar-Edges/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Planar-Edges/

#### Solution
What in fact is asked is Catalan numbers here, so we can use direct formula after we precompute factorials and inverse factorials.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
MOD, M = 10**9 + 7, 10**5//2
F = [1]*(M+1)
for i in range(1, M+1):
    F[i] = (F[i-1] * i) % MOD

I = [1]*M + [pow(F[M], MOD - 2, MOD)]
for i in range(M-1, 0, -1):
    I[i] = I[i+1]*(i+1) % MOD

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        return (F[n] * I[n//2] * I[n//2 + 1]) % MOD
```
