[greedy, dp, intervals, sort]

Let `dp[pos]` be the minimum cost to cover segment `[pos, m]`. In the beginning we initialize it as `[m, m-1, ..., 0]`, because we always can extend the leftest segment. Then we can go with decreasing `x`, where we have two options:
1. If position `pos` is already covered initially, we do `dp[pos] = dp[pos + 1]`.
2. In the opposite case, consider all segments `[x, y]`, where `x > pos`, then if we extend this segment we will spend `x - pos - 1` cost and we have `dp[min(m, y + cost)]` subproblem to solve.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(m * n)`.

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
ints = []
 
for i in range(n):
	c, scope = map(int, input().split())
	ints += [[max(0, c - scope), min(m, c + scope)]]
 
dp = list(range(m, -1, -1))
 
for pos in range(m-1, -1, -1):
    for x, y in ints:
        if x <= pos + 1 <= y:
            dp[pos] = dp[pos + 1]
            break
 
        if pos < x:
            cost = (x - pos - 1)
            dp[pos] = min(dp[pos], cost + dp[min(m, y + cost)])
 
print(dp[0])
