#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Finding-Binary-Search-in-a-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Finding-Binary-Search-in-a-String/

#### Solution
We can do bruteforce here: check all possible candidates of length `m = 11`: we have `O(n)` cases for start and `O(n//m)` cases for step, so in total we need to check `O(n^2)` cases.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(m)` for space, where `m = 11` here.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
	n = len(s)
        return any(s[i:i+d*12:d]=="binarysearch" for d in range(1, n//11+1) for i in range(n-11*d))
```
