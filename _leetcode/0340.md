#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/

#### Solution
Almost the same what we have in problem **0159**, but here we have $k$, not $2$ distinct symbols.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n)$, because in total we have $2n$ movements of our pointers. Space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(k)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s, k):
        window = Counter()
        beg, end, ans, n, dist = 0, 0, 0, len(s), 0
        
        while beg < n and end < n:
            if (dist == k and window[s[end]] > 0) or dist < k:
                if end + 1 < n: window[s[end]] += 1
                if window[s[end]] == 1: dist += 1
                end += 1
                ans = max(ans, end - beg)
            else:
                window[s[beg]] -= 1
                if window[s[beg]] == 0: dist -= 1
                beg += 1
        
        return ans    
```
