#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-to-base-2/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-to-base-2/

#### Solution
Actually not difficult problem, all we need to do is to apply usual algorithm for base `2`, but for `-2`: it will work here.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def baseNeg2(self, n):
        if n == 0: return "0"
        ans = []
        while n != 0:
            ans += [n % 2]
            n = (n - ans[-1])//(-2)
        
        return "".join(str(i) for i in ans[::-1])
```
