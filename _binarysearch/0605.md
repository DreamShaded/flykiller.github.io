#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Equal-Partitions/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Equal-Partitions/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0416. Partition Equal Subset Sum.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(N*n)`, where `N = sum(A)` and `n = len(A)`. Space complexity is `O(N)`. Note, that in practice however it will work several times faster than usual dp due to fast bit operations.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        a = reduce(lambda a, num: a|(a<<num), A, 1)
        return sum(A)%2 == 0 and a & (1 << (sum(A)//2)) != 0
```
