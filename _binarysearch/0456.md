#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Fleet-of-Palindromes/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Fleet-of-Palindromes/

#### Solution
The idea is that we can not have a lot of letters with `odd` frequency and also that number of parts is less than length of string.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, k):
        return sum(x % 2 == 1 for x in Counter(s).values()) <= k <= len(s)
```
