<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/A-Maniacal-Walk/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/A-Maniacal-Walk/

#### Solution
Variation of Leetcode 1269. Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n * m)` here for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, length, n):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(ind, s):
            if not 0 <= ind < length: return 0
            if s == 0: return ind == 0
            return (dp(ind-1, s-1) + dp(ind, s-1) + dp(ind+1, s-1)) % MOD
        
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        return int(dp(0, n))
```
