tags: [string, hash table]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/single-row-keyboard/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/single-row-keyboard/

#### Solution
First, collect all places for all letters in `keyboard`. Then iterate through `word` and add absolute difference to answer. Also we need to deal with first letter, for this I add `keyboard[0]` to the start of `word`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(26 + n)`, space complexity is `O(26)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def calculateTime(self, keyboard, word):
        places = {s: i for i, s in enumerate(keyboard)}
        ans = 0
        for x, y in zip(word, keyboard[0] + word):
            ans += abs(places[x] - places[y])
            
        return ans
```
