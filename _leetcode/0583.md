title: Leetcode 0583. Delete Operation for Two Strings
tags: [string, dp]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/

#### Solution
Almost the same as **Problem 1143** Longest Common Subsequence. Let us define by `dp(i, j)` the length of the longgest common subsecuence. Then, what we need to return is `m + n - 2*dp(m-1,n-1)`. We can use either dynamic programming for this:
 1. If `i < 0 or j < 0`, it means that one of the words is empty, so return `0`.
 2. If `word1[i] == word2[j]`, it means that we have common symbol, so return `dp(i-1, j-1) + 1`.
 3. Finally, if symbols are not equal, check two options: `dp(i-1, j)` and `dp(i, j-1)` and choose the best of them: maximum: because we want to find the **longest** commong subsequence.
 
 #### Complexity
 Time and space complexity is `O(mn)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1, word2):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i,j):
            if i < 0 or j < 0: return 0
            if word1[i] == word2[j]: 
                return dp(i-1,j-1) + 1
            else:
                return max(dp(i-1,j), dp(i,j-1))

        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
        return m + n - 2*dp(m-1, n-1)
```
