#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition-ii/

#### Solution
We can note, that `[0, 0]` will always be increased by `1` for every range we have. What cells also will be increased by `1` for every range? It is all coordinates, where `x <= min(all x cooridnates)` and `y <= min(all y coordinates)`.

So we need to find minimum of all `x` coordinates and multiply it by minimum of all `y` coordinates. If we have empty update list, we need to return `m * n` (because all elements still equal to `0`) so we can add it to our `ops`. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(k)`, where `k` is number of updates, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, m, n, ops):
        return min(i for i,_ in ops+[[m,n]]) * min(j for _,j in ops+[[m,n]])
```
