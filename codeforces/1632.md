#### Problem A statement
[string, palindrome]

<a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1632/problem/A"> <font color = blue>https://codeforces.com/contest/1632/problem/A


#### Solution
If length if more than `2` or we have `00` or `11`, then we can choose palindrome, it the opposite case, no.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
I = lambda: [int(x) for x in input().split()]
T = int(input())
 
for _ in range(T):
    n = I()
    s = input().rstrip()
    if len(s) >= 3 or s == "00" or s == "11":
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
```


#### Problem B statement
[greedy, constructive]

<a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1632/problem/B"> <font color = blue>https://codeforces.com/contest/1632/problem/B

#### Solution
The idea is if we have say `n = 28`, then we have `x = 16 = 10000`, and if we look at the first bit, there will be adjacent pair, where it is goes from `1 -> 0` or `0 -> 1`. It means, that we can not make answer smaller than `16`. Also we can construct answer in the way `15 14 13 ... 0  16 17 18 ... 28`: in the first part values will be `<= 16`, in the second as well and also `0 ^ 16 = 16`. 

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
I = lambda: [int(x) for x in input().split()]
T = int(input())
 
for _ in range(T):
    n = I()[0]
    x = 1<<((n-1).bit_length() - 1)
    arr = list(range(x-1, -1, -1)) + list(range(x, n))
    print(" ".join(str(x) for x in arr))
```


#### Problem C statement
[greedy]

<a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1632/problem/C"> <font color = blue>https://codeforces.com/contest/1632/problem/C

#### Solution
The idea is that operation number `3` can be used only once. Also it can be shown that
1. We increase `a -> x`, then we increase `b` to `x | b` and finally use operation `3`.
2. We increase `b -> y`, then we increase `a` to `a | y` and finally use uparation `3`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(b)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
import sys
 
input = sys.stdin.readline
I = lambda: [int(x) for x in input().split()]
T = int(input())
 
for _ in range(T):
    a, b = I()
    ans = float("inf")
    for x in range(a, b + 1):
        ans = min(ans, (x | b) - b + x - a + (x != b))
 
    for y in range(b, (a|b) + 1):
        ans = min(ans, (a | y) - b + (a != y))
 
    print(ans)
```


#### Problem D statement
[sparse table, math, segment tree, intervals, binary search, dp, greedy]

<a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1632/problem/D"> <font color = blue>https://codeforces.com/contest/1632/problem/D

#### Solution
The idea is that `gcd(xk, ..., xl)` will decrease when `l` increased. For every element `l` find the biggest `r`, such that `gcd(xk, ..., xl) >= r - l + 1` using binary search and sparse table (gcd have properties for this) (or segment tree). We call segment **bad** if we have equality. Then the idea is find all **bad** segments: we have no more than `n` of them.

After this we can use greedy strategy with `dp`: dp[i] = `dp[i-1]` if end is not occupied and `dp[ints[i-1]] + 1` if we have end in this point - hopefully we can have only one end for each segment.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n log A)`, where `log A` here because we have `gcd`.

#### Code
```python
from math import gcd
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
I = lambda: [int(x) for x in input().split()]

class RangeQuery:
    def __init__(self, data, func):
        self.func = func
        self._data = _data = [data]
        i, n = 1, len(_data[0])
        while 2 * i <= n:
            prev = _data[-1]
            _data.append([func(prev[j], prev[j + i]) for j in range(n - 2 * i + 1)])
            i <<= 1

    def query(self, L, R):
        depth = (R - L).bit_length() - 1
        return self.func(self._data[depth][L], self._data[depth][R - (1 << depth)])

n = int(input())
arr = I()
STable = RangeQuery(arr, gcd)
ints = {}

for i in range(n):
    beg, end = i, n
    while beg + 1 < end:
        mid = (beg + end)//2
        if STable.query(i, mid + 1) >= mid - i + 1:
            beg = mid
        else:
            end = mid

    if STable.query(i, end) == end - i:
        ints[end - 1] = i

dp = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    dp[i] = dp[i-1] if i-1 not in ints else dp[ints[i-1]] + 1

print(" ".join(str(x) for x in dp[1:]))
```
