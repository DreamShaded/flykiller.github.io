tags: [tree, dfs, recursion]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/

#### Solution
We need to make sure that left subtree is reflected version of right subtree and to do it in recursion way. We can do it, using new function `dfs` and then apply this function to the root.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root):
        def dfs(n1, n2):
            if not n1 and not n2: return True
            if not n1  or not n2: return False
            
            return n1.val == n2.val and dfs(n1.left, n2.right) and dfs(n1.right, n2.left)
        
        return dfs(root.left, root.right)
```
