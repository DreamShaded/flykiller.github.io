#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/All-Sublists-Sum/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/All-Sublists-Sum/

#### Solution
For each index we can calculate how many subarrays with this index we have.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        return sum(x*(i+1)*(n-i) for i, x in enumerate(nums)) % (10**9 + 7)
```
