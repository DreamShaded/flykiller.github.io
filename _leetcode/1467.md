This is an interesting mathematical problem. Denote by `k` different number of balls and by `B1, ..., Bk` number of balls of each type. Then we need to put into first box `X1, ..., Xk` balls and into the second `B1 - X1, ..., Bk - Xk`. We need to check 2 properties:
1. Number of balls in two boxes are equal.
2. Number of ball types in each boxes are equal.

Then we need to evaluate total number of possibilites for boxes, using **Multinomial coefficients**, (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem for more details) and divide it by total number of possibilities. Let us work through example: `B1, B2, B3 = 1, 2, 3`, then all possible ways to put into boxes are:
1. (0, 0, 0) and (1, 2, 3)
2. (0, 0, 1) and (1, 2, 2)
3. (0, 0, 2) and (1, 2, 1)

...

22. (1, 2, 1) and (0, 0, 2)
23. (1, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 1)
24. (1, 2, 3) and (0, 0, 0)

But only for 2 of them holds the above two properties:
1. (0, 2, 1) and (1, 0, 2)
2. (1, 0, 2) and (0, 2, 1)

So, the answer in this case will be `[M(0, 2, 1) * M(1, 0, 2) + M(1, 0, 2) * M(0, 2, 1)]/ M(1, 2, 3)`

**Complexity** We check all possible `(B1+1) * ... * (Bk+1)` splits into two boxes, and then evaluate number of zeros and multinomial coefficientes, so it is `O(B1 ... Bk * k)`

**Update** There is more elegant way to use multinomial coefficients, which I updated.

```python
class Solution:
    def multinomial(self, n):
        return factorial(sum(n))/prod([factorial(i) for i in n])
  
    def getProbability(self, balls):
        k, n, Q = len(balls), sum(balls)// 2, 0
        arrays = [range(0,i+1) for i in balls]
        t = list(product(*arrays))
        for i in range(len(t)):
            if sum(t[i]) == n and t[i].count(0) == t[-i-1].count(0):
                Q += self.multinomial(t[i]) * self.multinomial(t[-i-1]) 

        return Q / self.multinomial(list(balls))     
```
