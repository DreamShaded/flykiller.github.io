#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Latin-Square/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Latin-Square/

#### Solution
Just check each row and column. Also check that in total we have `n` elements.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, M):
        n = len(M)
        s = set()
        for row in chain(M, zip(*M)):
            rset = set(row)
            if len(rset) != n: return False
            s |= rset
        return len(s) == n
        
        
```
