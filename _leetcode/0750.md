title: Leetcode 0750 Number Of Corner Rectangles
tags: [math, hash table]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-corner-rectangles/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-corner-rectangles/

#### Solution
Iterate over each row of table and keep pairs of coordinates, where both values equal to `1`, put them to counter. In the end, for each element of counter calculate `i*(i-1)/2`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2m)`, space complexity is `O(n^2)` (or `O(m^2n)/O(m^2)`).

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countCornerRectangles(self, grid):
        d = Counter()
        
        for row in grid:
            for t in combinations([i for i, t in enumerate(row) if t == 1], 2):
                d[t] += 1
                
        return sum(i*(i-1)//2 for i in d.values())
```
