#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/

#### Solution
This is a very old and classical problem. We are asked to find number of prime numbers in some range, and the most used idea here is to apply so-called **sieve of Eratosthenes**.  The idea is to progressivly remove numbers which are not prime. First, we start with even numbers, that is numbers, which are divisible by `2`. Then we remove all numbers, divisible by `3`, then by `5` (we skip `4`, because it is already divisible by `2`) and so on. It is quite easy to code: let us have `sieve`, where value will be `1` for prime numbers and `0` for not prime. In the beginning we put two first elements as `0`, because zero and one are not prime numbers. Then we check if `sieve[k]` is prime and if it is, we mark numbers `k*k, k*(k+1), ... ` as not primes. It is enough to start with `k*k`, because any not-prime number have divisor less or equal than its square root.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n*log log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space. For more details please check wikipedia.

#### Code

```
class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n):
        sieve = [0, 0] + [1] * (n - 1) 
        for k in range(ceil(n**0.5) + 1):
            if sieve[k]:
                for i in range(k*k, n+1, k):
                    sieve[i] = 0
                                 
        return sum(sieve[:-1])
