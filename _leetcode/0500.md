title: Leetcode 0500 Keyboard Row
tags: [string, hash table]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/keyboard-row/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/keyboard-row/

#### Solution
Note, letters can be capital and can be not capital. Create hash table with `26` elements, with correspondences between letters and row. Then just traverse each word, apply `.lower()` and check that all letters are from the same row. 

#### Complexity
Space complexity is `O(26)`, time complexity is `O(m)`, where `m` is total number of symbols in our data.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findWords(self, words):
        keys = ["qwertyuiop", "asdfghjkl", "zxcvbnm"]
        d = {}
        for i, line in enumerate(keys):
            for s in line: d[s] = i
        
        return [word for word in words if len(set(d[s] for s in word.lower())) == 1]
```
