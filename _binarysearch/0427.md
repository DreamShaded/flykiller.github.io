title: BinarySearch 0427 Longest Path in a Graph
tags: [graph, dp, topological sort]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Path-in-a-Graph/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Path-in-a-Graph/

#### Solution
Because it is DAG, we can use dp here: `dp(node)` is the longest path ending with `node`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(E)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, G):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(node):
            if not G[node]: return 0
            return max(dp(neib) for neib in G[node]) + 1

        return max(dp(i) for i in range(len(G))) 
```
