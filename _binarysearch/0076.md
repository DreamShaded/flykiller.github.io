#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Merging-Binary-Trees/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Merging-Binary-Trees/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0617 Merge Two Binary Trees

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n1 + n2)`, where `n1` and `n2` are number of nodes in each tree and space complexity is `O(max(h1, h2))`, where `h1` and `h2` are heights of trees.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, t1, t2):
        if t1 and t2:
            t1.val += t2.val
            t1.left = self.solve(t1.left, t2.left)
            t1.right = self.solve(t1.right, t2.right)
            return t1
        
        if t1 and not t2: return t1
        if t2 and not t1: return t2
```
