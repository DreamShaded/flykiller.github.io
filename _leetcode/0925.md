tags: [string, groupby, two pointers]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/long-pressed-name/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/long-pressed-name/

#### Solution
One way to solve is to use two pointers approach. Another way is to use groupby and then check that for each group symbols are equal and we have correct inequality.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(m + n)`, where `m` is the length of `name` and `n` is the length of `typed`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isLongPressedName(self, name, typed):
        def group(s): 
            return [(i, len(list(j))) for i, j in groupby(s)]
        
        g1, g2 = group(name), group(typed)
        if len(g1) != len(g2): return False
        for (l1, f1), (l2, f2) in zip(g1, g2):
            if l1 != l2 or f1 > f2: return False
        return True
```
