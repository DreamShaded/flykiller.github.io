#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-string-is-decomposable-into-value-equal-substrings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-string-is-decomposable-into-value-equal-substrings/

#### Solution
Let us calcualte lengths of each group of values. If we have length `0, 3, 6, 9, ...`: we can separate them into groups of size `3`. If we have length `1, 4, 7, 10, ...` we need at least 2 groups of length `2` (in fact group of length `1` can not be seprated at all, but we can assume it it `2`, because in the end we just check if it is `== 1`. If we have `2, 5, 8, 11, ...`, then we have one group of length `2`. We are happy if we have only one number from the last group and zero from other groups.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space compexity is `O(n)` as well (space can be reduced to `O(1)`)

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isDecomposable(self, s):
        lens = [len(list(j)) for i, j in groupby(s)]
        d = {0:0, 1:2, 2:1}
        return sum(d[i%3] for i in lens) == 1
```
