#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Largest-Gap/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Largest-Gap/

#### Solution
Just sort and do what is asked. Notice, that there is also `O(n)` time complexity solution.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        nums = sorted(nums)
        return max(y - x for x, y in zip(nums, nums[1:]))
```
