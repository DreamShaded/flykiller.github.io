#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/super-palindromes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/super-palindromes/

#### Solution
It this problem we can use the fact, that number of super palindromes is not very big one. If we have superpalindrome `X`, then by definition `X = Y*Y`, where `Y` is also palindrome. Note also, that palindrome is defined by the first half `Z` of its digits, so if we consider all `Z` in region `[1, W^0.25]` it will be enough. Indeed, let us consider all `Z` in region `[1, 10^5)`, it will be enough: in this case `Y` will be in range `[1, 10^9)` and X will be in range `[1, 10^18)`.

So, what I did here is just precompute all palindromes and then use binary search to calculate number of them.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(W^0.25 * log W)`, where `W = 10^18` is the upper limit. Here we have `log W` factor, because for each candidate we transfrom it to string and also becauswe we use sort in the end. Space complexity is `O(W^0.25)`. Note also that in practice this will work quite fast, because we evaluate `nums` outside function, so it will be calculated only once.

```python
from bisect import bisect

class Solution:
    nums = []
    for i in range(1, 100000):
        cand1 = int(str(i) + str(i)[::-1])**2
        cand2 = int(str(i)[:-1]  + str(i)[::-1])**2
        if str(cand1) == str(cand1)[::-1]: nums += [cand1]
        if str(cand2) == str(cand2)[::-1]: nums += [cand2]

    nums = sorted(list(set(nums)))

    def superpalindromesInRange(self, L, R):
        return bisect(self.nums, int(R)) - bisect(self.nums, int(L)-1)
```
