title: BinarySearch 0705 Pair Matches Larger Than Target
tags: [sort, binary search]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Pair-Matches-Larger-Than-Target/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Pair-Matches-Larger-Than-Target/

#### Solution
Sort numbers, then if we want to make `k` pairs we need to choose `k` smallest and biggest values with equal index gaps. Then use binary search to find `k`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A, target):
        A = sorted(A)
        n = len(A)
        def check(k):
            return min(A[i + n - k] - A[i] for i in range(k))

        beg, end = 0, len(A)//2 + 1
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end) >> 1
            if check(mid) >= target:
                beg = mid
            else:
                end = mid
        return beg
```
