#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Coprime-Suspects/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Coprime-Suspects/

#### Solution
Number of steps will be always `0, 1` or `2`, because we can make numbers even.

#### Complexity
It is `O(1)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, a, b):
        if gcd(a, b) != 1: return 0
        if gcd(a, b-1) != 1 or gcd(a, b+1) != 1 or gcd(a-1, b) != 1 or gcd(a+1, b) != 1: return 1
        return 2
```
