title: Leetcode 0406. Queue Reconstruction by Height
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0406/
---

The idea of my solution is following: let us find the first person in our queue, how can we do it? First, it should be a person with `k=0`, and also it should be a person with minumum height among all these people. What happened, when we found this person? We need to update values of `k` for all persons after, for which heights were less or equal than this person. However in this way we modify our data, so I use line `people = [[x,y,y] for x, y in people]` to reconstrunct our data: `0`-th index is for height, `2`-nd for modified `k` and `1`-st for original `k`.

Let us go through example and see how it works, `people = [[7, 0], [4, 4], [7, 1], [5, 0], [6, 1], [5, 2]]`:

1. Modify data: `[[7, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4], [7, 1, 1], [5, 0, 0], [6, 1, 1], [5, 2, 2]]`
2. Choose the smallest element with `k_modified = 0`: this is `[5,0,0]`: we pop this element and modify the rest: `[[7, 0, 0], [4, 4, 3], [7, 1, 1], [6, 1, 1], [5, 2, 1]]`, where we changed values of `k_modified` for `[4, 4, 4]` and `[5, 2, 2]`
3. Choose the smallest new element, which is `[7, 0, 0]` and modify `people = [[4, 4, 2], [7, 1, 0], [6, 1, 0], [5, 2, 0]]`
4. Choose the smallest new element, which is `[5, 2, 0]` and modify `people = [[4, 4, 1], [7, 1, 0], [6, 1, 0]]`
5. Choose the smallest new element, which is `[6, 1, 0]` and modify `people = [[4, 4, 0], [7, 1, 0]]`
6. Choose the smallest new element, which is `[4, 4, 0]` and modify `people = [[7, 1, 0]]`
7. Choose the smallest new element, which is [`7, 1, 0]` and modify `people = []`

**Complexity.** Time complexity is `O(n^2)`, because we do `n` iterations, and find minimum and modify at most `n` elements on each iteration. Space comlexity is `O(n)`.


```python
class Solution:
    def reconstructQueue(self, people):
        people = [[x,y,y] for x, y in people]
        
        out = []
        while people:
            ind = people.index(min(people,key=lambda x: (x[2],x[0])))
            out.append(people.pop(ind))
            people = [[x,y,z - (x <= out[-1][0])] for x,y,z in people ]
    
        return [[x,y] for x,y,z in out]
