#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-perfect-square/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-perfect-square/

#### Solution
Simple approach is to check for all numbers `k` if `k^2 = num`. Complexity is `O(sqrt{n})`. Smarter approach is Binary Search with `O(log n)` complexity.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and `O(1)` for space

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isPerfectSquare(self, num):
        beg, end = 1, num
        while end - beg  > 1:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if mid*mid > num:
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid
                
        return beg*beg == num
```
