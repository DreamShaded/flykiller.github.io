title: Leetcode 0785. Is Graph Bipartite
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0785/
---

This problem is very similar to problem **886. Possible Bipartition** and it happens that I already solved this problem previously, you can see my solution here: https://leetcode.com/problems/possible-bipartition/discuss/654840/Python-Simple-dfs-traversal-O(E%2BV)-detailed-explanations

Here I do absolutely the same idea, but with a bit more clear coding style and also we do not need to create adjacency list here, it is already given in this way. The idea is the following: we traverse our graph and color our nodes int two colors `0` and `1`: first one for nodes which can be reached with even number of steps and `1` for odd number of steps. Also we keep `self.loop` flag, which is true if we found `odd` loop, that is our graph is not bipartite. 

We define `dist` array with `-1` inside and then we start dfs from every node, and color our graph (note, that graph can have several connected components, so we need to start dfs from all nodes).

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(E+V)`, because it is complexity of classical `dfs` we are using. Space complexity is `O(V)` to keep `dist` array. Here `E` is number of edges and `V` is number of vertices.


```python
class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, graph):
        def dfs(start):
            if self.loop: return     #early stop if we found odd cycle

            for neib in graph[start]:
                if dist[neib] >= 0 and dist[neib] == dist[start]:
                    self.loop = True
                elif dist[neib] < 0:
                    dist[neib] = dist[start]^1
                    dfs(neib)
            
        n = len(graph) 
        self.loop, dist = False, [-1] *(n)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if self.loop: return False     #early stop if we found odd cycle
            if dist[i] == -1:
                dist[i] = 0
                dfs(i)
                
        return True
