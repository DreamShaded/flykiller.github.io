[Number Theoretic Transform, dp, combinatorics, divide and conquer]

First idea is to use inclusion exclusion formula to get 
$$answer = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k\cdot f(k) \cdot (n-k)!,$$
where $f(k)$ is number of ways to choose $k$ restrictions, such that we do not have conflict in them, that is no two nodes have the same parent. We can try to solve it with dp:

Denote by `dp[i, j]` number of ways if we consider first `i` nodes and take `j` edges such for each node we choose at most one children. Then we can write: `dp[i+1, j] = dp[i, j] + T*dp[i, j-1]`, where `T` is number of children of node `i+1`:
1. Do not take `i+1` to children edge, then we have `dp[i, j]` options.
2. We take `i+1` to some children edge and we have `dp[i, j-1]*T` options.

Unfortunately it will give TLE, because complexity is `O(n^2)`. If we look carefully on this transforms, we can look at it at polynomial multiplication: `(1 + Tx)*...`, which can be done in `O(n log^2n)` time.

#### Remark
There is optimization for this problem: we can mulpitly polynomials a bit faster: we can us binomial theorem: first we can group all equal terms, like `(1+2x)^3 * (1+3x)^2` and then multiply resulting polynomials, each time chooseing two of them with smallest degrees.
