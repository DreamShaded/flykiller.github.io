#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-movie-rental-system/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/design-movie-rental-system/

#### Solution
This is a problem with quite heavy statement, but in fact it can be solved pretty strarightforward using `SortedList` library in python. The idea is to keep several pieces of information:

1. `self.shops` is dictionary: for every movie we keep sorted list of tuples `(price, shop)`.
2. `self.shop_movie` is dictionary, which allows us to answer what is price, given shop and movie.
3. `self.rented` is SortedList of rented movies so far.

Now, lwt us go through our functions and check how they work:

1. `_ _init_ _`: here we create empty objects, and then fill `self.shops` and `self.shop_movie`. We keep `self.rented` empty, because we did not rent any movies yet.
2. `search(movie)`: we go through first `5` elements of `self.shops[movie]` and return prices.
3. `rent(shop, movie)`: first, we find price, using our `self.shop_movie` dictionary and then remove this movie from given shop and add it to rented.
4. `drop(shop, movie)`: very similar to previous one, now we add movie back to shop and remove it from rented.
5. `report` Here we look at `self.rented` and take `5` cheapes movies, that is `5` first elements.

#### Complexity
1. `_ _ init _ _`: time is `O(n log n)`, space is `O(n)`.
2. `search(movie)`: time is `O(log n)`, space is `O(1)`.
3. `rent(shop, movie)`: time is `O(log n)`, additional space is `O(1)`.
4. `drop(shop, movie)`: time is `O(log n)`, additional space is `O(1)`.
5. `report`: time is `O(log n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class MovieRentingSystem:
    def __init__(self, n, entries):
        self.shops = defaultdict(SortedList)   #movie -> (price, shop)
        self.shop_movie = {}    #(shop, movie) -> price
        self.rented = SortedList()  # (price, shop, movie)
        for s, m, p in entries:
            self.shops[m].add((p, s))
            self.shop_movie[s, m] = p

    def search(self, movie):
        return [y for _,y in self.shops[movie][:5]]
        
    def rent(self, shop, movie):
        price = self.shop_movie[shop, movie]
        self.shops[movie].remove((price, shop))
        self.rented.add((price, shop, movie))

    def drop(self, shop, movie):
        price = self.shop_movie[shop, movie]
        self.shops[movie].add((price, shop))
        self.rented.remove((price, shop, movie))
        
    def report(self):
        return [[y,z] for _,y,z in self.rented[:5]]
