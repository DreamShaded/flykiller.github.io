title: Leetcode 0082. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II 
tags: []
---

Idea here is to traverse our linked list and use two pointers:

1. `slow` is for node just before duplications begins
2. `fast` is for the last node of duplication group.

Now, we traverse nodes and do the following steps:
1. while we have `fast.next` and its value is equal to `fast`, it means, than we have one more duplicate, so we move `fast` pointer to the right.
2. If it happen, that `slow.next` equal to `fast`, it means, that we have only `1` element in group of duplicated elements, that is we do not need to delete it and we move both pointers to right.
3. If it happen, that `slow.next` is not equal to `fast`, it means, that we need to skip group of duplicated elements: we create new connection: `slow.next = fast.next`, and also we allocate `fast = slow.next`. Note, that now we still have the original property: `slow` points to node before group of duplicated elements and `fast` will be the last element of this group (after `while fast.next and fast.val == fast.next.val:` line)

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`: we traverse our list at most twice for each of the pointers. Space complexity is `O(1)`: we did not use any additional memory here.

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        fast, slow = head, dummy
        while fast:
            while fast.next and fast.val == fast.next.val:
                fast = fast.next
            if slow.next == fast:
                slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next
            else:
                slow.next = fast.next
                fast = slow.next
                
        return dummy.next
```
