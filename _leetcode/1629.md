#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/slowest-key/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/slowest-key/

#### Solution
This is a kind of problems, where you probably spend more time reading problem statement, than solving it. What we need to do is just check all keys and how much time we press then and then choose the biggest one. We can do it with oneliner, using functionality of **zip** function.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space, because `zip` is iterator and do not use additional memory.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def slowestKey(self, T, K):
        return max((t2 - t1, k) for t1, t2, k in zip(chain([0], T), T, K))[1]
```
