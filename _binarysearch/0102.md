#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Consecutive-Duplicate-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Consecutive-Duplicate-String/

#### Solution
We can use groupby to find the longest group/

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        return max(len(list(y)) for x, y in groupby(s)) if s else 0
```
