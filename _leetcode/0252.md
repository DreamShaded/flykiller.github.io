#### Solution
All we need to to is to sort intervals by its starts and check that start of each interval is not less than end of previous.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n\log n)$, space complexity is $O(n)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals):
        intervals = sorted(intervals, key = lambda x:x[0])
        return all(x[1]<=y[0] for x,y in zip(intervals, intervals[1:]))
```
