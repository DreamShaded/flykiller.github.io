title: Leetcode 0198. House Robber

Nice and easy dynamic programming problem! Let `dp1` be maximum gain we can get, using last `i-1` houses and `dp2` maximum gain we can get, using `i` houses. How we need to update these numbers if we go from `i` to `i+1`? So `dp1` and `dp2` should mean gain for `i` and `i+1` houses.

1. `dp1 = dp2`, gain to rob `i+1-1` houses is gain to rob `i` houses.
2. `dp2 = max(dp1 + num, dp2)`: we have 2 choices: either rob house number `i+1`, then we can rob `i`th house, so we have total gain `dp1 + num`, or we do not rob `i+1`th house, then we can gain `dp2`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums):
        dp1, dp2 = 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            dp1, dp2 = dp2, max(dp1 + num, dp2)          
        return dp2 
```
