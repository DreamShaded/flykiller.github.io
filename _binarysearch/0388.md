#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Outstanding-Move/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Outstanding-Move/

#### Solution
This is an easy version of BinarySarch 0389 Outstanding Move problem, where we can have `O(n^2)` algorithm.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        base = sum(i * x for i, x in enumerate(A, 1))
        P = [0] + list(accumulate(A))
        ans, n = 0, len(A)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n + 1):
                ans = max(ans, P[i] - P[j] - (i - j) * A[i])

        return base + ans
```
