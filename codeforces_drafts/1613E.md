[graph, deque, bfs, game]

Oficial solution advices to deal with this problem as game with two players on graph.
However it can be a bit easier: what we need to start from lab and follow only paths which are unique. This paths can merge in some moment, we need to deal with it. So, we will use queue, where we mark visited cells by +. Each time we extract node from the left and try to visit all neighbours: if we do not have fork, we continue to process. There are couple of ways to code it:

1. O(mn*4), where we keep for each node number of possible ways to go from this node.
2. O(mn*16)`, where we do it on the flight. However it works almost the same because of several passes in first algo.


```python
from collections import deque

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = []
    lx = ly = 0
    c = [0, 1, 0, -1, 0]
    for i in range(n):
        l += [list(input())]
        if "L" in l[-1]:
            lx, ly = i, l[-1].index("L")

    IN = lambda x, y: 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m

    d = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            if l[x][y] != ".": continue
            for k in range(4):
                nx = x + c[k]
                ny = y + c[k+1]
                d[x][y] += IN(nx, ny) and l[nx][ny] != "#"
 
    q = deque([(lx, ly)])
    while q:
        x, y = q.popleft()

            if not IN(nx, ny) or l[nx][ny] != ".": continue
            d[nx][ny] -= 1
            if d[nx][ny] <= 1:
