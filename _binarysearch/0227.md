#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Dice-Throw/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Dice-Throw/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum. 

#### Complexity
It is `O(n * total * k)` for time and `O(n * total)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, k, total):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(n, total):
            if total < n: return 0
            if total == n: return 1
            if n == 0: return total == 0
            return sum(dp(n - 1, total - x) for x in range(1, k + 1)) % (10**9 + 7)
        
        return dp(n, total)
```

#### Remark
There is also `(n * total)` time complexity solution if we precalculate prefix sums. There is also `O(n + total)` time complexity solution.
