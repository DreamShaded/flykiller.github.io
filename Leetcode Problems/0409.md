title: Leetcode 0409. Longest Palindrome
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0409/

Note, that it every palindrome we need to use every letter `even` number of times, maybe except one letter in the middle. Note also, that this condition is also sufficient: if we have frequencies for each letter which are even and one frequence is odd, we can always create palindrome. For example let us have `aaaaaa`, `c`, `bbbb`, then we create `aaabbcbbaaa`.

So, all we need to do is to count frequencies of each letter and take as much letters as possible. There are two possible cases:
1. If we have only `zero` or `one` letters with odd frequencies, then we can use all the letters.
2. If we have `k>1` letters with odd frequencies, we need to remove exactly `k-1` letter to build palindrome.

**Complexity**: space complexity is `O(k)`, where `k` is size of used alphabet. Time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is length of our string: we process it once to get counter, then we find reminders of frequencies modulo `2` in `O(k)`.


```
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        odds = sum([freq % 2 for _,freq in Counter(s).items()])
        return len(s) if odds <=1 else len(s) - odds + 1 
```

### Oneliner
The same logic can be written as oneliner
```return len(s) if (o:=sum([f%2 for _,f in Counter(s).items()])) <=1 else len(s)-o+1```
