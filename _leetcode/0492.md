title: Leetcode 0492 Construct the Rectangle
tags: [math]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/

#### Solution
We need to find the biggest divisor of number `n`, which is not more than $\sqrt{n}$. So, just start from $d = \sqrt{n}$ and decrease $d$, until $n$ can be divided by $d$.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(sqrt{n})`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def constructRectangle(self, area):
        for i in range(int(sqrt(area)), 0, -1):
            if area % i == 0:
                return [area//i, i]
```
