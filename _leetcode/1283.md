It this problem we need to find the smallest divisor, given a threshold. Notice, that this is perfect problem for binary search: we have row of answers for questions are we higher than threshold for given number? : `no, no, no, ... no, yes, yes, ... yes` and we need to find the place with first yes.
1. We define `beg = 0`, `end = max(nums) + 1`, so we know that answer for `beg` is `no` and we also know that answer for `end` is `yes`.
2. Look at the middle number: if answer is yes, it means, that we need to look at the right part: so you again have range with `no` in the beginning and `yes` in the end. If answer is no, we consider the second half.
3. Finally, we will find interval with size 2: `no, yes`, and we need to return `end`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n log N)`, where `n` is lenght of `nums` and `N` is biggest number from `nums`. Additional space complexity is `O(1)`. (though we already have `O(n)` for our data)

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestDivisor(self, nums, threshold):
        beg, end = 0, max(nums) + 1
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if sum(ceil(num/mid) for num in nums) <= threshold:
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid        
        return end
```
