tags: [array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked: find maximum number and then iterate over all numbers and check if they at least twice smaller or not.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def dominantIndex(self, nums):
        m = max(nums)
        if all(m >= 2*x for x in nums if x != m):
            return nums.index(m)
        return -1
```
