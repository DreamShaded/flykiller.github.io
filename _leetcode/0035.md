### Solution 1: bisect
It is not said in the problem statement not to use any libraries, so why not use `bisect_left` function, so conviniently provided by python? Why we use `bisect_left`? Because for `[1,3,5,6]` and number `5` we need to return index `2`: if element is already present in array, the insertion point will be before (to the left of) any existing entries.

**Complexity** is classical for binary search: `O(log n)`

```python
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums, target):
        return bisect.bisect_left(nums, target)
```

### Solution 2: Classical binary search

Classical binary search problem, where we need to return `beg` in the end, because we are looking for left place to insert our symbol.

```python
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums, target):
        beg, end = 0, len(nums)
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if nums[mid] >= target:
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid + 1
        return beg
```
