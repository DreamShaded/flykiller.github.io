#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/

#### Solution
Create counter of string `T`. First we need to iterate all symbols from `S` and if they are in our counter, add them to answer and remove these symbols from counter. Then iterate through the rest of counter and add symbols to the end of string. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n+26)`, where `n` is size of `T` and `26` is size of alphabet. Space complexity is `O(26)` to keep counter.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, S, T):
        cnt, ans = Counter(T), ""
        for s in S:
            if s in cnt:
                ans += s*cnt[s]
                cnt.pop(s)
                
        return ans + "".join(s*cnt[s] for s in cnt) 
```
