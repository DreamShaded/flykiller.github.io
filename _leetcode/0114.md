#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/

#### Solution
I saw several really nice and short solutions for this problem, howerer sometimes it is a quite difficult to digest them. Here I tried to find the solution, which can be easily reproduced during real-time interview. The idea as in other solutions is to use recursion.

Let use `helper(node)` function which return the first and the last elements of linked lists, constucted from subtree of `node`. Then we can have several cases:

1. If there is no `left` and no `right` children, then we just return `(node, node)`, because in this case the list for `node` has only one element.  `node ->`
2. If there is no `left` children but there is `right` children,  we have a case `node -> b2 -> ... -> e2 ->`. Then we need to create new connection `node -> b2`.
3. If there is `left` children and there is no `right` children, we have a case `node -> b1 -> ... -> e1 ->`, and we need to create connection `node -> b1`.
4. If there is `left` and `right` children, we have a case `node -> b1 -> ... -> e1 -> b2 -> ... -> e2 ->`.  Then we need to create two more connections: `node -> b1` and `e1 -> b2`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)` to traverse our tree once. Space complexity we can say `O(h)`, because we reuse existing nodes with recursion stack.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root):
        def helper(node):
            if not node: return (None, None)
            b1, e1 = helper(node.left)
            b2, e2 = helper(node.right)
            node.left = None
            
            if not e1 and not e2:
                return (node, node)
            if not e1 and e2: 
                node.right = b2
                return (node, e2)
            if e1 and not e2:
                node.right = b1
                return (node, e1)
            else:
                node.right = b1
                e1.right = b2
                return (node, e2)

        helper(root)
```
