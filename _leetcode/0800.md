title: Leetcode 0800 Similar RGB Color
tags: [string, math]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/similar-rgb-color/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/similar-rgb-color/

#### Solution
For each channel `(R, G, B)`: we need to find closest color: we will use `closest(s)` function for this. We need to find the closest between given color `s` and colors `00, 11, 22, ... , ff`: which are represented as `0, 17, 34, ... 17 * 15` in decimal base. When we found closest, we transform it back, using `hex` function. Finally, we go through `3` parts and create number. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(16 * 3)`, because for each of `3` blocks we check `16` different options.

#### Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def similarRGB(self, color):
        def closest(s):
            t = min(range(16), key = lambda x: abs(17*x - int(s, 16)))
            return hex(t)[2:]*2

        return "#" + "".join(closest(color[2*i+1:2*i+3]) for i in range(3))
```

#### Remark
Actually, we can check not `16` options, but only two, but here it is not worth it, complexity is already very small.
