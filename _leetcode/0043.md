#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/

#### Solution
It is simulation like multiplication works: you do it digit by digit, and then not to forget about carries. Let us put create `d`: counter where we put all multiplications for given place. Then we traverse through dictionary and evaluate sum, using carry.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)`, space is `O(m+n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1, num2):
        m, n = len(num1), len(num2)
        d = Counter()
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                d[i+j] += int(num1[m-1-i])*int(num2[n-1-j])
                
        carry, ans = 0, ""
        for i in range(m+n-1):
            carry, digit = divmod(carry + d[i], 10)
            ans += str(digit)
            
        ans = (str(carry) + ans[::-1]).lstrip("0")
        return ans if ans != "" else "0"
```
