tags: [hash table, two pointers, sort]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/

#### Solution
Put number into set and evaluate intersection of two sets.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m + n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums1, nums2):
        return set(nums1) & set(nums2)
```

#### Remark
We can also sort our sets and use two pointers approach with overall `O(n log n + m log m)` complexity.
