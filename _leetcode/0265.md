#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house-ii/

#### Solution
Let `dp[i][j]` be the minimum cost to paint houses upto number `i` such that last house has color `j`. Then `dp[i][j]` = $\min\limits_{k\neq j}$ `dp[i-1][k] + costs[i][j]`. To be able to update this in $O(1)$ we need to keep **two** smallest cells from $i-1$-the column of our table, which can be done in $O(k)$ time.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(nk)$, space complexity can be done in $O(k)$, if we use only last row of matrix, as I did in the following code.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minCostII(self, costs):
        n, k = len(costs), len(costs[0])
        if k == 1 and n == 1: return costs[0][0]
        dp = [0]*k
        
        for cost in costs:
            dp_new = [0]*k
            min_ind = dp.index(min(dp))
            for i in range(k):
                if i != min_ind:
                    dp_new[i] = dp[min_ind] + cost[i]
                else:
                    dp_new[i] = min(dp[i] for i in range(k) if i != min_ind) + cost[i]
                    
            dp = dp_new
            
        return min(dp) 
```
