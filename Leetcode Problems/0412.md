title: Leetcode 0412. Fizz Buzz
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0412/

This is very classical and old interview question and I think already a lot was discussed. Here is my solution, where we use simple approach: we iterate over numbers, check for each number what we need to add and add it. Also, for more universality I use `words = ["Fizz", "Buzz"]`, `mods = [3,5]` and `k=2`. What we do next is just iterate over numbers and for each number check if it is divisible by `3` and by `5`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, more precisely, we do `2` division checks for each number and then add result to `res`. It can be optimized, if we do not check each number, but firstly create array `[1,2,3,...,n]`, and then traverse only numbers divisible by `3` in one pass and numbers divisible by `5` in second pass. Space complexity is `O(n)` as well.

```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n):
        words, mods = ["Fizz", "Buzz"], [3, 5]
        k, res = 2, []
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            current_str = ""
            for j in range(k):
                if i%mods[j] == 0: current_str += words[j]
                    
            if not current_str:
                res.append(str(i))
            else:
                res.append(current_str)
                
        return res
```
