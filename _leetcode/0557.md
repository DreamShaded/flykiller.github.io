#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/

#### Solution
Just use build-in functions if it is allowed: split string, reverse each part and then construct back. If it it not allowed, we can use Two Pointers approach.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        return " ".join(x[::-1] for x in s.split())
```
