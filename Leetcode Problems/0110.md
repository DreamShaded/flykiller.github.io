title: Leetcode 0110. Balanced Binary Tree
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0110/
---

What we need to do here is just to traverse our tree, using for example dfs and check balance for every node.

`dfs(node)` here returns depth of subtree with root in `node`. If it is `None`, depths is equal to `0`. We evaluate depths of left and right subtee and return maximum of them plus one. Also we check balance and if absolute difference is more than `1`, we can mark variable `self.Bal` as False: we can state now that tree is not balanced.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)` as any classical dfs have.

```python
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root):
        self.Bal = True
        
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return 0
            lft, rgh = dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right)
            if abs(lft - rgh) > 1: self.Bal = False
            return max(lft, rgh) + 1
            
        dfs(root)
        return self.Bal
```
