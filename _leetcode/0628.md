#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-three-numbers/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-three-numbers/

#### Solution
Note, that result is either three biggest numbers multiplied, or two smallest (which can be negative) multiplied by biggest. One way is to sort numbers and find answer in `O(n log n)`. Another is to directly find `3` biggest and `2` smallest number in `O(n)`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumProduct(self, nums):
        A = [float('-inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf')]
        B = [float('inf'), float('inf')]
        for num in nums:
            if   num >= A[0]: A = [num, A[0], A[1]]
            elif num >= A[1]: A = [A[0], num, A[1]]
            elif num >= A[2]: A = [A[0], A[1], num]
                
            if   num <= B[0]: B = [num, B[0]]
            elif num <= B[1]: B = [B[0], num]

        return max(A[0]*A[1]*A[2], A[0]*B[0]*B[1])
```
