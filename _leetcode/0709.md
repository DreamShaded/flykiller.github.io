title: Leetcode 0709. To Lower Case
tags: [string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/to-lower-case/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/to-lower-case/

#### Solution
I assume here, that we can not use `lower()` function, because in the opposite case we can just `return s.lower()`. If we are not allowed to do it on real interview: we need to traverse our string and look at symbols. What we need to do is to make each capital letter small letter, that is `A -> a, B -> b, ... Z -> z`. Codes of all small letters are adjacent and codes of all capital letters are adjacent too, so to make capital letter small, we can use `chr(ord(i) + 32)`, where `32 = ord("a") - ord("A")`. Then we just combine our string back.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `s`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def toLowerCase(self, s):
        return "".join(chr(ord(i) + 32) if "A" <= i <= "Z" else i for i in s)
```
