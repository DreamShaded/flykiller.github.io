#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/

#### Solution
One way to solve this problem is just to check all `2^n` possible combinations, using dfs with backtracking. Complexity will be `O(2^n)`.

We can also solve this problem, using dp. We can reformulate: we need to find some subset of `nums`, such that its sum is equal to `(S - M)/2`, where `M` is sum of all numbers. Denote by `dp[i]` numbers of ways to construct number `i`. Then we can solve this problem in `O(n * M)` time complexity and `O(M)` space complexity.

There is also very smart my solution, I am proud of, using generative functions, which is currently the fastest solution on leetcode for this problem. The idea is to take base `x = 2**21` and then multiply polynoms $(1 + x^{s_1})\cdot \dots \cdot (1 + x^{s_n})$. We can take this `x`, because `n <= 20` and coefficients will be no more than `2^20`.

#### Complexity
We can say it is `O(n * M)` but with pretty small constant.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findTargetSumWays(self, nums, S):
        a = sum(nums) - S
        if a < 0 or a%2==1: return 0 
        S = [((1<<(i*21))+1) for i in nums]
        return reduce(lambda p, i:(p*i)&(1<<((a//2+1)*21))-1, S, 1)>>(21*a//2)
```
