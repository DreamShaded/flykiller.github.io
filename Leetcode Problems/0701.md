title: Leetcode 0701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0701/
---

What we need to do in this problem is just traverse our tree and find the correct place for our new value:

1. If we have `val < root.val`, we need to go left: if it is possible, we go left; if left children is not existing, then we create it with `val` value.
2. If we have `val > root.val`, we need to go right: if it is possible, we go right; if right children is not existing, then we create it with `val` value.

Finally, we run our `dfs` function from `root` and return `root`.

**Complexity** time and space complexity is `O(h)`, where `h` is height of our tree.

```
class Solution:
    def insertIntoBST(self, root, val):
        def dfs(root):
            if val < root.val:
                if root.left:
                    dfs(root.left)
                else:
                    root.left = TreeNode(val)
            else:
                if root.right:
                    dfs(root.right)
                else:
                    root.right = TreeNode(val)
        
        if not root: return TreeNode(val)
        dfs(root)
        return root
```
