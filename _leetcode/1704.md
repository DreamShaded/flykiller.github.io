tags: [string]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-string-halves-are-alike/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-string-halves-are-alike/

#### Solution

Very easy problem, we just need to do what is asked. Let us first make all symbols lowercase, evaluate `n`: length of our string and define `cand = set("aeiou")` for quick check if letter is vowel.

Then we jut calculate number of vowels in each half and return result.

#### Complexity
It is just `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

#### Code
```
class Solution:
    def halvesAreAlike(self, s):
        s, n, cand = s.lower(), len(s), set("aeiou")
        return sum(i in cand for i in s[:n//2]) == sum(i in cand for i in s[n//2:])
```
