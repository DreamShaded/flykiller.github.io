#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-log-storage-system/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/design-log-storage-system/

#### Solution
The main difficulty is to parse our string with granularity. For example if we have day granularity, we need to compare only starts of our strings: `2017:01:01`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(1)` for `Put` and `O(n)` for `Retrieve`, because we are checking all elements. We can also use binary search for search, if we use SortedList, but complexity will be still `O(n)` (it can be `O(log n)`, if we need to return number of logs, but not all of them).

#### Code
```python
class LogSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logs = []

    def put(self, id, timestamp):
        self.logs.append((timestamp, id))

    def retrieve(self, s, e, gra):
        ind = {"Year":4, "Month":7, "Day":10, "Hour":13, "Minute":16, "Second":19}[gra]
        beg, end = s[:ind], e[:ind]
        return [id for time, id in self.logs if beg <= time[:ind] <= end]
```
