#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Reverse-Words/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Reverse-Words/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0186 Reverse Words in a String II.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time. Space would have been `O(1)` if it was array of characters, not strings.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, sentence):
        s = [i for i in sentence]
        def reverse(i, j):
            while i < j:
                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
                i, j = i + 1, j - 1
        
        beg, end = 0, 0
        while end < len(s):
            if s[end] == " ":
                reverse(beg, end - 1)
                beg, end = end + 1, end + 1
            else:
                end += 1
                
        reverse(beg, end - 1)
        reverse(0, len(s) - 1)
        return "".join(s)
```
