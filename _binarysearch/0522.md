#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-String/

#### Solution
Calculate how many elements we have in common using counters, then subtract this number form length.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(26)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, t):
        return len(s) - sum(x for x in (Counter(s) & Counter(t)).values())
```
