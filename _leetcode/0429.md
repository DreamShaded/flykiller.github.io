title: Leetcode 0429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal
tags: [tree, bfs]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal/

#### Solution
Nothing very special about this problem, in fact it is very similar to problem **0102**. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal. The idea is to use any graph traversal, here I use bfs. We keep queue `Q` with value in current level. Then we do `len(Q)` extractions from the left and add all children to the right. Also we add all values fro this level to `ans`. Note that we always keep invariant: first we traverse full first layer, then it is fully removed and second layer added and so on.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)` to traverse our tree, space complexity is `O(n)` as well to return answer.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root):
        if not root: return []
        Q, ans = deque([root]), []
        
        while Q:
            level = []
            for i in range(len(Q)):
                node = Q.popleft()
                for child in node.children:
                    Q.append(child)
                level += [node.val] 
            ans += [level]

        return ans
```
