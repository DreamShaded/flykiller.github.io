#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/A-Student/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/A-Student/

#### Solution
Similar to Leetcode 0630. Course Schedule III, but here instead of removing the course with the smallest duration from heap, we remove the course with smallest credits.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, deadlines, credits):
        heap = []
        for deadline, val in sorted(zip(deadlines, credits)):
            heappush(heap, val)
            if len(heap) > deadline + 1:
                heappop(heap)
        return sum(heap)
```
