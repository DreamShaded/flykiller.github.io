#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-disjoint-intervals/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-disjoint-intervals/

#### Solution
Let us look more carefully at the phrase: `every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right`. Actually it means that maximum of the left part is less or equal than minimum of the right part. So, let us calculate the following arrays:
1. `t1` is accumulate maximum, starting from the left side.
2. `t2` is accumulate minimum, starting from the right side.
3. Iterate throught these two arrays and find the first `i`, where `t1[i-1] <= t2[i]`: it will mean that we found exaclty the correct place.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def partitionDisjoint(self, A):
        t1 = list(accumulate(A, max)) 
        t2 = list(accumulate(A[::-1], min))[::-1]
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            if t1[i-1] <= t2[i]: return i
```
