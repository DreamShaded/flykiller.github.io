#### Solution
Variation of Leetcode 0312. Burst Balloons.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^3)` for time and `O(n^2)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        A = [1] + A + [1]

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i, j):
            return max([A[i]+A[k]+A[j] + dfs(i,k) + dfs(k,j) for k in range(i+1, j)] or [0])
        
        return dfs(1, len(A) - 2)
```
