#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Inverse-Factorial/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Inverse-Factorial/

#### Solution
Number of factorials which fit `2**31` limit is not big, we can try them all.

#### Complexity
It is `O(1)` here we can say.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, a):
        d = {factorial(x):x for x in range(12)}
        return d.get(a, -1)
```
