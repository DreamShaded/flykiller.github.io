#### Solution
Equal to leetcode 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        dp = [10**10] * (len(nums) + 1)
        for elem in nums: dp[bisect_left(dp, elem)] = elem  
        return dp.index(10**10)
```
