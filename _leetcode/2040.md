#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-product-of-two-sorted-arrays/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-product-of-two-sorted-arrays/

#### Solution
The idea of this problem is to use binary search: let `check(x)` be the answer to the question: how many products are less or equal than `x`. Then we use binary search and find the first moment where we have exactly `k` such numbers.

1. If `n1` is positive, then values in `nums2 * n1` go in increasing order, so we use bisect to find number of values which are `<= x//n1`.
2. If `n1` is negative, then values in `nums2 * n1` going in decreasing order, so we need to take the right part.
3. If `n1` equal to `0`, than all values in `nums2 * n1` are equal to `0`. So, we update `total` only if `x >= 0`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*log m* log N)`, where `n = len(nums1)`, `m = len(nums2)` and `N = 10**10 + 10` is the maximum value of product. Space complexity is `O(1)`


#### Code
```python
from bisect import bisect, bisect_left

class Solution:
    def kthSmallestProduct(self, nums1, nums2, k):
        def check(x):
            total = 0
            for n1 in nums1:
                if n1 > 0: total += bisect(nums2, x//n1)
                if n1 < 0: total += len(nums2) - bisect_left(nums2, ceil(x/n1))
                if n1 == 0 and x >= 0: total += len(nums2)

            return total

        beg, end = -10**10 - 1, 10**10 + 1

        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if check(mid) >= k:
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid

        return beg + 1
```
