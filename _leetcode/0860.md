#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/

#### Solution
Each time we have `5` dollar bill, we just pay it. Each time we have `10` dollar bill, we check if we can give change. Each time when we have `20` dollar bill, first we check if we have `5` and `10` bills: we want to get rid off `10` dollars first. If we can not do it, we look for three `5` dollar bills and finally if we can not find it, we return false.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lemonadeChange(self, bills):
        amount = {5:0, 10:0, 20:0}
        for bill in bills:
            if bill == 5: 
                amount[5] += 1
            elif bill == 10:
                if amount[5] == 0: return False
                amount[10] += 1
                amount[5] -= 1
            else:
                if amount[10] >= 1 and amount[5] >= 1:
                    amount[10] -= 1
                    amount[5] -= 1
                    amount[20] += 1
                elif amount[5] >= 3:
                    amount[5] -= 3
                    amount[20] += 1
                else:
                    return False
                
        return True
```
