title: Leetcode 0646 Maximum Length of Pair Chain
tags: [dp, greedy, intervals]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/

#### Solution
Basically, almost the same as problem **0435** Non-overlapping Intervals, but here we need to find the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals and they can not have the same ends.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findLongestChain(self, pairs):      
        count, curr = 0, -float("inf")
        for x, y in sorted(pairs, key = lambda x: x[1]):
            if curr < x:
                count += 1
                curr = y        
        return count   
```

It can also be solved with DP in `O(n^2)`, similar to Problem **0300** Longest Increasing Subsequence.
