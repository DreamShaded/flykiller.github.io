We just need to do what is asked in the name of this problem: binary search! Also we need to find index of found element, so we check `3` conditions: `nums[mid] == target`, `nums[mid] < target` and `nums[mid] > target`.


**Complexity** is `O(log n)`, classical complexity of binary search, because on each step we reduce searching region twice.

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums, target):
        beg, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while beg <= end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if nums[mid] == target: return mid
            if nums[mid] < target:
                beg = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid - 1
        return -1
```
