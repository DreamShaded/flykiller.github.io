#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Anagram-Partitioning/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Anagram-Partitioning/

#### Solution
Go element by element and keep in counter difference of frequencies for each letter. Also keep `total` is number of values which are not equal to `0`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(26)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, a, b):
        n = len(a)
        cnt, total, ans = Counter(), 0, []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if total == 0:
                ans += [i]
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
            if cnt[a[i]] == 1: total += 1
            cnt[b[i]] -= 1
            if cnt[b[i]] == 0: total -= 1

        return ans if Counter(a) == Counter(b) else []
```
