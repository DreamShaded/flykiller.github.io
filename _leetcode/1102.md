#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-minimum-value/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-minimum-value/

#### Solution
This problem is almost identical to problem **0778**. Swim in Rising Water, the difference here is that we need to start with big values and instead of small. The following is the solution using heaps.

#### Complexity
It is `O(MN*log MN)` for time and `O(MN)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumMinimumPath(self, grid):
        M, N = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        heap, visited, res = [(-grid[0][0], 0, 0)], set([(0, 0)]), -float("inf")
        
        for i in range(N*M):
            val, x, y = heappop(heap)
            res = max(res, val)
            if x == M-1 and y == N-1: return -res
            neib_list = [[0,1],[0,-1],[1,0],[-1,0]]
            
            for dx, dy in neib_list:
                if (x + dx, y + dy) not in visited and 0<=x+dx<M and 0<=y+dy<N:
                    heappush(heap, (-grid[x+dx][y+dy], x+dx, y+dy))
                    visited.add((x+dx, y+dy))

```
