#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-common-element-in-all-rows/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-common-element-in-all-rows/

#### Solution
All we need to do is to calculate frequencies of all elements and take element with frequency `m` if we have it and `-1` if we are not.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` both for time and space

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestCommonElement(self, mat):
        cnt = Counter(chain(*mat))
        t = max(cnt.values())
        return -1 if t < len(mat) else min(x for x in cnt if cnt[x] == t)
```
