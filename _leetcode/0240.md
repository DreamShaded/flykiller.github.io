Let us consider the following example and discuss the algorithm.

| 1  | 4  | 7  | 11 | 15 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| **2**  | **5**  | **8**  | **12** | **19** |
| **3**  | **6**  | **9**  | **16** | **22** |
| **10** | **13** | **14** | **17** | **24** |
| **18** | **21** | **23** | **26** | **30** |

Let us start with element on the top right corner and on each step we decide where we can go.

1. Current number is equal to **15**, and `target = 5`, where can we go? All numbers above `15` is more than `15`, so we can eliminate last column and go to the left.
2. Current number is equal to **11** and again it is bigger than `target = 5`, so we eliminate column and go to the left
3. Current number is equal to **7**, go to the left.
4. Current number is **4**, now it is smaller than target, so we can eliminate first row: elements to the left is smaller than `4` and elements to the right already eliminated in columns.
5. Current number is **5** and we found our target.

It also can happen, that we do not found number, in this case we need to terminate, when we can not move anymore.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(m + n)`, where `m, n` are number of columns and rows: on each step we eliminate either row or column. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix, target):
        x, y = len(matrix[0]) - 1, 0
        while x >= 0 and y < len(matrix):
            if matrix[y][x] > target:
                x -= 1
            elif matrix[y][x] < target:
                y += 1
            else:
                return True
        return False
```
