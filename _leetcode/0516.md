title: Leetcode 0516 Longest Palindromic Subsequence
tags: [dp, string]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/

#### Solution
Let us define by `dp[i][j]` the maximum length of palindromic sub-sequence for `s[i:j+1]`. Then we need to look at `dp[i][j-1]`, `dp[i+1][j]` and to `dp[i+1][j-1]` if `s[i] == s[j]`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity will be `O(n^2)`, space complexity is `O(n^2)`, which can be reduced to `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if j - i <= 1: return j - i
            if s[i] == s[j-1]: 
                return dp(i + 1, j - 1) + 2
            else:
                return max(dp(i, j-1), dp(i + 1, j))
                
        return dp(0, len(s))
```
