#### Solution 1

Go over all possible substrings of length `k` and add them to set, and check in the end if the size of our set is `2^k`. 

**Complexity** is `O(nk)`, do you know if it can be solved in better complexity?

```python
class Solution:
    def hasAllCodes(self, s, k):
        sset = set()
        for i in range(len(s) - k + 1):
            sset.add(s[i:i+k])
        return len(sset) == 1 << k
```

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. If you like solution and explanations, please **Upvote!**

#### Solution 2

However we can do better. First of all, notice, that `k` is quite small, so all substrings of length `k` can fit to `int32` number. Let us consider an example:

`s = 00110011`, `k = 3`.

Let us look at substrings of length `3` and see how they change when we move:

`001 -> 011 -> 110 -> 100 -> 001 -> 011`.

Note, that each moment of time we need to multiply number by `2`, subtract first symbol multiplied by `2^k` and add last symbol. This is called rolling hash, but in fact we just calculate value of number, written in base `2`. When we calculate hash, we put it into set and in the end we check if we have `2^k` elements in set.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, we just traverse our string once. Space complexity is `O(min(n, 2^k))`.

```python
class Solution:
    def hasAllCodes(self, s, k):
        last = int(s[:k], 2)
        ss = {last}
        for i in range(k, len(s)):
            last = last*2 - (int(s[i-k])<<k)  + int(s[i])
            ss.add(last)
        
        return len(ss) == 1<<k
```
