#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/

#### Solution
The idea is to use topological sort. Let us traverse all pairs of adjacent words, for example if we have `aylksga` and `aymst`, we can state that `l` must go before `m`. Also we need to check that if we have case like `agsag` and `ags`, than no matter what happens else, answer will always be false. After we create our connections graph, we need to perform `dfs` with $3$ colors for all components. In the end if we found loop, return `""`, and if we did not, return reversed order. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(m)$, where $m$ is total length of all words, this part will be bigger than dfs part. Space complexity is $O(d + \min(d^2, n))$, where $d$ is the size of alphabet and $n$ is lenght of `words`. 

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def alienOrder(self, words):
        def dfs(node):
            if visited[node] == 1:
                self.FoundCycle = 1
            if visited[node] == 0:
                visited[node] = 1
                for neib in graph[node]: dfs(neib)
                visited[node] = 2
                self.ans += node
        
        exist, visited = set("".join(words)), Counter()
        self.ans, self.FoundCycle = "", 0
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        for w1, w2 in zip(words, words[1:]):
            for i, j in zip(w1, w2):
                if i != j:
                    graph[i].append(j)
                    break
            if w1.startswith(w2) and w1 != w2: return ""

        for i in exist:
            if visited[i] == 0:   dfs(i)

        if self.FoundCycle == 1:   return "" 
        return self.ans[::-1]
```
