#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/

#### Solution
Just iterate element by element and check look for group of repeating elements. We will use `beg` and `end` pointers for the start and for the end of group of equal elements. On each iteration we first look group, then write `S[beg] = char` and finally write frequency of this symbol just after.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, S):
        beg, end = 0, 0
        n = len(S)
        
        while end < n:
            char, size = S[end], 1
            while end + 1 < n and char == S[end + 1]:
                size, end = size + 1, end + 1
                
            S[beg] = char
            
            if size > 1:
                len_str = str(size)
                S[beg + 1:beg + 1 + len(len_str)] = len_str
                beg += len(len_str)
            beg, end = beg + 1, end + 1
        return beg
```
