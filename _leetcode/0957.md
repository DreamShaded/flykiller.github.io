Let us solve this problem by definition: we do iteration by iteration. However if `N` is very big, then we spend `O(N)` time and it can take too much time. Note, that there can be only `2^8` possible options for cells (in fact only `2^6` even, because after first step the first and the last symbols will always be zeros). It means, that afrer some number of iterations, cells start to repeat, and we found a **loop**.

How can we find a loop? We need to keep our positions in hash-table, so we can find `loop_len`.  We do iteration by iteration and if we found a loop, we need to do `(N - i) % loop_len` more steps.

**Complexity**: time and memory is `O(64)`, because the loop size will be not more than `64`.

```python
class Solution:
    def next_step(self, cells):
        res = [0] * 8
        for i in range(1,7):
            res[i] = int(cells[i-1] == cells[i+1])
        return res
    
    def prisonAfterNDays(self, cells, N):
        found_dic = {}
        for i in range(N):
            cells_str = str(cells)
            if cells_str in found_dic:
                loop_len = i - found_dic[cells_str]
                return self.prisonAfterNDays(cells, (N - i) % loop_len)
            else:
                found_dic[cells_str] = i 
                cells = self.next_step(cells) 
                
        return cells
```

**PS** there are also solutions which are using the fact that if there is a loop, it will always have length `14` (or divisor of it). However will you find this on real interview?
