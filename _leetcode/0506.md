#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks/

#### Solution
Just sort numbers, keeping original indexes. Then traverse sorted array, and put everyone on its place.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findRelativeRanks(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        pairs = sorted(zip(nums, range(n)), reverse = True)
        out = [0]*n
        medals = {0: "Gold", 1: "Silver", 2: "Bronze"}
        for i, (j, k) in enumerate(pairs):
            out[k] = medals[i] + " Medal" if i <= 2 else str(i + 1)
        
        return out
```
