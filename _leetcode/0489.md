#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-room-cleaner/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-room-cleaner/

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(E+V) = O(V)`, where `V` is number of vertexes in our graph, that is number of empty cells. However due to all rotations and backtracking constant will be high, something like `O(10V)`. Space complexity is `O(V)` to keep all visited nodes.

#### Code 1
```python
class Solution:
    def cleanRoom(self, robot):
        visited = set()
        def dfs(x, y, dx, dy):
            robot.clean()
            visited.add((x, y))

            for _ in range(4):
                if (x + dx, y + dy) not in visited and robot.move():
                    dfs(x + dx, y + dy, dx, dy)
                robot.turnRight()
                dx, dy = -dy, dx

            for _ in range(2): robot.turnRight()
            robot.move()
            for _ in range(2): robot.turnRight()

        dfs(0, 0, 0, 1)
```

#### Code 2

Alternative way is to use for `direction` one number and increase it after each dfs `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> ...`

```python
class Solution:
    def cleanRoom(self, robot):
        visited = set()
        dirs = [[0,1], [-1,0], [0,-1], [1,0]]
		
        def dfs(x, y, dr):
            robot.clean()
            visited.add((x, y))
			
            for i in range(4):
                 cur = (i + dr)%4
                 newX, newY = x + dirs[cur][0], y + dirs[cur][1]
                 if (newX, newY) not in visited and robot.move():
                     dfs(newX, newY, cur)
                 robot.turnRight()

            for _ in range(2): robot.turnRight()
            robot.move()
            for _ in range(2): robot.turnRight()
                     
        dfs(0, 0, 0)
```
