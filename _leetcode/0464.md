#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/can-i-win/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/can-i-win/

#### Solution
Let `n = maxChoosableInteger`. Then we can define position in our game as binary mask with `n` bits (we have also number `desiredTotal = m` minus already used number, but it can be defined uniquely). 

#### Complexity
From every position we can take no more than `n` turns, so we can use DP on `O(2^n)` positions - space complexity with `O(n 2^n)` time complexity (if we do not use memorization it will be `O(n!)`).

#### Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def canIWin(self, n, m):
        if (1 + n) * n//2 < m: return False
        
        @lru_cache(None)  
        def dp(mask, t):
            for i in range(n):
                if 1<<i & mask:
                    if i+1 >= t or not dp(mask^1<<i, t-i-1): return True
            return False
        
        return dp((1<<n)-1, m)
```
