title: Leetcode 2008. Maximum Earnings From Taxi
tags: [dp, binary search, sort]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-earnings-from-taxi/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-earnings-from-taxi/

#### Solution
This problem is very similar to problem **1235.** Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling. The only difference is what profit we have given our ride: it is calculated as `rides[k][2] - rides[k][0] + rides[k][1]`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m log m)`, where `m = len(rides)`.

#### Code
```python
import bisect

class Solution:
    def maxTaxiEarnings(self, n, rides):
        rides = sorted(rides)
        S = [i[0] for i in rides]
        
        m = len(rides)
        dp = [0]*(m+1)
        for k in range(m-1, -1, -1):
            temp = bisect_left(S, rides[k][1])
            dp[k] = max(dp[k+1], rides[k][2] - rides[k][0] + rides[k][1] + dp[temp])
            
        return dp[0]
```
