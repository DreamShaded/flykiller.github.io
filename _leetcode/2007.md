title: Leetcode 2007. Find Original Array From Doubled Array
tags: [sort, greedy, counter]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-original-array-from-doubled-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-original-array-from-doubled-array/

#### Solution
This problem is very similar to problem **0954**. Array of Doubled Pairs. The idea is that for the smallest number there is unique way to find its pair. So, we sort numbers and then start from the smallest numbers, each time looking for pairs. If we can not find pair, return `[]`. The only difference, which costs me 5 minutes fine was that we need to deal with `0` as well.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findOriginalArray(self, arr):
        cnt, ans = Counter(arr), []
        for num in sorted(arr, key = lambda x: abs(x)):
            if cnt[num] == 0: continue
            if cnt[2*num] == 0: return []
            ans += [num]
            if num == 0 and cnt[num] <= 1: return []
            cnt[num] -= 1
            cnt[2*num] -= 1
        
        return ans
```
