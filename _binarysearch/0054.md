#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Zipped-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Zipped-String/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0097. Interleaving String

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)`, because we have `mn` states and two transactions from one state to others. Space complexity is `O(mn)` as well, which can be reduced to `O(m + n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s1, s2, s3):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == -1 and j == -1: return True
            return (j >= 0 and dp(i, j-1) and s2[j] == s3[i+j+1]) or (i >= 0 and dp(i-1,j) and s1[i] == s3[i+j+1])
        
        return len(s1) + len(s2) == len(s3) and dp(len(s1) - 1, len(s2) - 1)
```
