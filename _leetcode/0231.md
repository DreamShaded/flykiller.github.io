This is classical bit manipulation problem for `n & (n-1)` trick, which removes the last non-zero bit from our number

**example**: 
1.`n = 100000`, then `n - 1 = 011111` and `n & (n-1) = 000000`, so if it is power of two, result is zero
2.`n = 101110`, then `n - 1 = 101101` and  `n & (n-1) = 101100`, number is not power of two and result is not zero.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n):
        return n > 0 and not (n & n-1)
```

**Update** there is another `O(1)` solution using math: number is power of `2` if it is divisor of the biggest possible power of `2`:

```return n > 0 and (1<<32) % n == 0```
