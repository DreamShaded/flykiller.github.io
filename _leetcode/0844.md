#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/

#### Solution
`O(n + m)` time and space solution is straightforward: use stack and imitate process.

If we want to do it in `O(1)` space, we need to go from the end of string, because if we go from the beginning we do not know in advance if symbol will be erased or not. Let `i, j` be indexes for the first and the second string and `backS, backT` be counter how many symbols we need to erase.  We iterate over both strings until we need to remove symbols and then compare symbols.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m + n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
# borrowed code
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, S, T):
        i, j = len(S) - 1, len(T) - 1
        backS = backT = 0
        while True:
            while i >= 0 and (backS or S[i] == '#'):
                backS += 1 if S[i] == '#' else -1
                i -= 1
            while j >= 0 and (backT or T[j] == '#'):
                backT += 1 if T[j] == '#' else -1
                j -= 1
            if not (i >= 0 and j >= 0 and S[i] == T[j]):
                return i == j == -1
            i, j = i - 1, j - 1
```
