#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze-ii/

#### Solution
Very similar to Problem **0499** Maze III, this problem is simpler version of it, here is solution, using Dijkstra algorithm. 

#### Complexity
Complexity of this solution is `O(mn * max(m,n) * log(mn))`, because it is usual Dijkstra complexity, but we potentially can spend `(O(max(m,n))` time to go from one node to another. It can be improved to `O(mn log(mn))`, if we precalculate all edges.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, maze, start, destination):
        if not maze: return False
        m, n = len(maze), len(maze[0])
        dirs = ((1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0))
        
        visited = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        heap = []
        heappush(heap, (0, start[0], start[1]))
        
        while heap:
            pt = heappop(heap)
            if pt[1:3] == tuple(destination):
                return pt[0]

            visited[pt[1]][pt[2]] = True

            for dx, dy in dirs:
                distance, newRow, newCol = pt

                while m>newRow+dx>=0 and n>newCol+dy>=0 and maze[newRow+dx][newCol+dy] != 1:
                    newRow += dx
                    newCol += dy
                    distance += 1
                    
                if not visited[newRow][newCol]:
                    heappush(heap, (distance, newRow, newCol) )
                
        return -1
```
