title: BinarySearch 0422 Count Exact Sum
tags: [dp]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Count-Exact-Sum/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Count-Exact-Sum/

#### Solution
Use `dp` technique here, where `dp` is how many subset with given sum we have when we used first `i` nubmers.

#### Complexity
It is `O(k * n)` for time and `O(k)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        dp = [1] + [0] * k
        for num in nums:
            dp2 = dp
            for x in range(k - num, -1, -1):
                dp2[x + num] += dp[x]
            dp = [x % (10**9 + 7) for x in dp2]
        
        return dp[-1]
```
