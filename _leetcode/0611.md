#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-triangle-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-triangle-number/

#### Solution
Let `n` be number of our numbers. Then bruteforce solution is `O(n^3)`. Another approach is to sort numbers and for each pair `a_i` and `a_j`, where `i<j` we need to find the biggest index `k`, such that `a_k < a_i + a_j`. It can be done with binary search with overall complexity `O(n^2 * log n)`.

There is even better solution, using two pointers approach. Let us choose first index `i`. Then we need to find number of pairs `(left, right)` where `left < right < i` and `a_{left} + a_{right} > a_i`. Let us start with `left = 1` and `right = i-1`. Then we can use **Two Pointers** approach to find number of desired pairs in`O(n)` for fixed `i`. Note, that it is very similar to all **2Sum** or **3Sum** problems.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def triangleNumber(self, nums):
        nums, count, n = sorted(nums), 0, len(nums)
        for i in range(2, n):
            left, right = 0, i-1
            while left < right:
                if nums[left] + nums[right] > nums[i]:
                    count += (right - left)
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    left += 1
        return count
```
