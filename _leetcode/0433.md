#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/

#### Solution
This problem is basically the same as problem **0126** and **0127** Word Ladder (II), but here we have smaller alphabet. Let `n` be number of words in our `bank`, then for each word we have maximum `3 * 8 = 24` neighbors, each of them can be checked in `O(8)` time. So we need `O(mnk^2) = O(8^2 * 3 * n)`, where `m` is alphabet size, `k` is word length time to create adjacency list. Then we use BFS with queue to find the shortest path with `O(E) = O(mnk)` complexity. 

#### Complexity
Overall complexity is still `O(mnk^2)` time and `O(mkn)` space.
I think we can use Bit Manipulation for this problem, which can increase speed.

#### Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def minMutation(self, start, end, bank):
        queue = deque([(0, start)])
        bankSet = set(bank)
        
        while queue:
            step, curr = queue.popleft()
            if curr == end: return step
            for i in range(8):
                for c in "AGCT":
                    neib = curr[:i] + c + curr[i+1:]
                    if neib in bankSet:
                        bankSet.remove(neib)
                        queue.append((step + 1, neib))
                        
        return -1
```
