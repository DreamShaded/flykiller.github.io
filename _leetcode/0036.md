#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/

#### Solution
We just need to check all `27` conditions - for every row, every column and every square.

1. First `3` lines of code to check rows and columns: we check each row in `board` and in transposed board `*board` and collect all elements which are not equal to `.`
2. Next `4` lines of code to check all `9` cells: first we create all centers of `3x3` cells and then again collect all elements, not equal to `.`

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is size of board, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board):
        for row in chain(board, zip(*board)):
            cand = [i for i in row if i != "."]
            if len(set(cand)) != len(cand): return False
            
        for x, y in product([1,4,7],[1,4,7]):
            cand = [board[x+i][y+j] for i,j in product([-1,0,1],[-1,0,1])]
            cand = [i for i in cand if i != "."]
            if len(set(cand)) != len(cand): return False
        
        return True
```
