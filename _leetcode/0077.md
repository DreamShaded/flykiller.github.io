#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/

#### Solution
Classical backtracking problem, good for practice. The idea is to use `helper(current)`, where `current` is built combination so far. Each time we check if we already built all combination and if yes, add it to `self.out`, if not: try to add new elements.

#### Complexity
It is `O(k*2^n)`, more accurate is `(k*C_n^k)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n, k):
        def helper(current):
            if len(current) == k+1:
                self.out.append(current[1:])
            else:
                for i in range(current[-1]+1, n+1):
                    helper(current + [i])
        
        self.out = []
        helper([0])
        return self.out
```
