#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-search-tree-to-sorted-doubly-linked-list/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-search-tree-to-sorted-doubly-linked-list/

#### Solution
Construct doubly linked list `L1 = lft_head...lft_tail` for left subtree, `L2 = rgh_head...rgh_head` for right subtree and then combine them in one big doubly linked list `L1 + root + L2` in `O(1)`. When we have leafs, create one-elements double linked lists. Do not forget the cases, when we have only left or only right children.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)` due to recursion stack. 

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def treeToDoublyList(self, root):
        def dfs(node):
            if node is None:
                return None, None
                
            lft_head, lft_tail = dfs(node.left)
            rgh_head, rgh_tali = dfs(node.right)
            
            if lft_head:
                lft_tail.right = node
                node.left = lft_tail
            if rgh_head:
                node.right = rgh_head
                rgh_head.left = node
            
            head = lft_head or node or rgh_head
            tail = rgh_tali or node or lft_tail
            
            return head, tail

        if root is None: return None
        
        head, tail = dfs(root)
        tail.right = head
        head.left = tail

        return head
```

#### Remark
There is also solution with `O(1)` complexity using inorder traversal.
See problems **0108, 0109**, which are opposite: we need to convert List (Single-Linked) to Balanced BST.
