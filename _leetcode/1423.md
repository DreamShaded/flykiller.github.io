#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/

#### Solution
What is asked in this problem: we need to take some numbers and some numbers from the beginning, such that the sum of therse taken `k` numbers are maximal. It is equivalent to take `n - k` adjacent numbers with minimal sum and then return sum of all numbers minus this value. So, all we need to do is:

1. Keep `wind` sum in the window of size `n - k`.
2. Move start and end of this window to the right and update `wind`. Note, that here we have **fixed** size of our window, so it is very easy.
3. Update `ans` on each step: `ans = min(ans, wind)`.
4. Finally, just return `S - ans`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is just `O(n)`, we iterate evaluate sums and then use sliding window, where we move only to the right. Note, that when evaluated `S` and `ans` we can do it in more optimal way, but it will not change the complexity. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, A, k):
        n, S = len(A), sum(A)
        ans = wind = sum(A[:n-k])
        for i in range(n-k, n):
            wind = wind - A[i-n+k] + A[i]
            ans = min(ans, wind)
        
        return S - ans
```
