#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/confusing-number-ii"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/confusing-number-ii

#### Solution
We can generate all numbers which have only digits $0, 1, 6, 8, 9$ and then check if they are confusing.

We can do optimization: let `dfs(num, num_rot, power)` be our backtracking function, where `num` is number with digits $0, 1, 6, 8, 9$, `num_rot` is rotated number, `power` 10 to the power of number of digits in our number. We need it for faster updates. Then on each step we try to add one digit to the end of `num`, and quickly compute new `num_rot`. Finally, we run function for all possible start $1, 6, 8, 9$.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(5^k)$, where $k$ is number of digits in $N$, space complexity is $O(k)$ to keep recursion stack.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def confusingNumberII(self, N):
        map = {0:0, 1:1, 6:9, 8:8, 9:6}
        self.ans = 0
        def dfs(num, num_rot, power):
            if num > N: return
            if num != num_rot: self.ans += 1
            for v in map.keys():
                dfs(num*10 + v, power*map[v] + num_rot, 10*power)

        for i in map.keys():
            if i == 0: continue
            dfs(i, map[i], 10)

        return self.ans
```

There is also digit build technique, but it is quite painful to code.
