#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-length-substrings-with-no-repeated-characters/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-length-substrings-with-no-repeated-characters/

#### Solution
The idea is to use sliding window of length `K`, where we calculate counter of elements inside.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(K)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numKLenSubstrNoRepeats(self, S, K):
        cnt, ans, n = Counter(), 0, len(S)
        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            cnt[c] += 1
            if i >= K:
                old = S[i - K]
                if cnt[old] == 1: cnt.pop(old)
                if cnt[old] >  1: cnt[old] -= 1
            if len(cnt) == K:
                ans += 1
        return ans
```
