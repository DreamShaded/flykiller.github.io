title: Leetcode 0532. K-diff Pairs in an Array
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0532/
---

Let us just use counter and count frequency of each number in our array. We can have two options:

1. `k > 0`, it means, that for each unique number `i` we are asking if number `i+k` also in table.
2. `k = 0`, it means, that we are looking for pairs of equal numbers, so just check each frequency.

**Complexity**: time and space complexity is `O(n)`, because we traverse our array twice: first time to create counter and second to find `res`.

```
class Solution:
    def findPairs(self, nums, k):
        count = Counter(nums)
        if k > 0:
            res = sum([i + k in count for i in count])
        else:
            res = sum([count[i] > 1 for i in count])
        return res
```
