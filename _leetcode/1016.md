#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-string-with-substrings-representing-1-to-n/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-string-with-substrings-representing-1-to-n/

#### Solution
First of all if n is big, then we have at least `n//3` substrings of the same length and if `n > len(s) * 3`, we do not have enough substrings of the same length. In the opposite case we can check bruteforce: complexity will be `O(n^2)`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def queryString(self, s, n):
        if n > len(s) * 3: return False
        return all(bin(i + 1)[2:] in s for i in range(n))
```

#### Solution 2
We can check all substrings of length `<= log(n)`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(s log^2n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def queryString(self, s, n):
        ans = set()
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for ii in range(i, i + n.bit_length()): 
                x = int(s[i:ii+1], 2)
                if 1 <= x <= n: ans.add(x)
        return len(ans) == n
```

#### Remark
We can also put all these substrings in trie and get `O(s log n)` solution. Or we can check range `(N//2, N]` only and check substrings of length `log(n)` and `log(n) - 1`.
