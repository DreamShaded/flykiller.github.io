title: Leetcode 0328 Odd Even Linked List
tags: [linked list, two pointers]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/

#### Solution
Classical Linked Lists problem, where we need to keep several pointers: `head0` and `head1` for head of odd and even sublists, these ones we do not change. We also keep `curr` and `nnext` pointers, which we going to update: `curr.next = nnext.next, curr = nnext, nnext = curr.next`. We also evaluate number of steps (parity of it) were made to sew lists in the end.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`, because we did not create new objects, but reconnect already existing.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next or not head.next.next:   #length <=2
            return head
        
        curr = head0 = head
        nnext = head1 = head.next
        
        steps = 0
        
        while nnext.next:
            curr.next = nnext.next
            curr = nnext
            nnext = curr.next
            steps += 1
            
        if steps % 2 == 1:
            curr.next = nnext.next
            nnext.next = head1
        else:
            curr.next = head1
            
        return head0
```
