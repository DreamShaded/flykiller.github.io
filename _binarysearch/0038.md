tags: [dp, counter]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Arithmetic-Subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Arithmetic-Subsequence/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence. Let `best[i, d]` means the longest arithmetic subsequence, which ends with element `A[i]` and have difference `d`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and space. 

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        best = Counter()
        for i in range(len(A)):
            for j in range(i):
                d = A[i] - A[j]
                best[i, d] = max(best[i, d], 1 + best[j, d])
        if not A: return 0
        if not best: return 1
        return max(best.values()) + 1
```
