#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-2d-vector/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-2d-vector/

#### Solution
Keep `3` pieces of information: `self.vec` is our list of lists, `self.x` is index in this list and `self.y` is index in `self.vec[self.x]`. Also we use `helper` function which will keep invariant: it will always point to existing index, that is if elements ended in some list, it will point to the next non-empty one.
1. `next(self)` now is just calling for helper, save element, increase `self.y` and return saved element.
2. `hasNext(self)` is just calling for helper and checking that we are not in the very end, that is `self.x < len(self.vec)`.

#### Complexity
Imagine, that we have $n$ elements in total in list of lists and $m$ elements in total if we count empty lists. Then to construct we need $O(1)$ time and to run `next` and `hasNext` it is in average $O(m/n)$, that is to traverse all list with $n$ elements we need $O(m)$ operations. Space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Vector2D:
    def __init__(self, vec):
        self.vec = vec
        self.x = 0
        self.y = 0
        
    def helper(self):
        while self.x < len(self.vec) and self.y == len(self.vec[self.x]):
            self.x += 1
            self.y = 0

    def next(self):
        self.helper()
        ans = self.vec[self.x][self.y]
        self.y += 1
        return ans

    def hasNext(self):
        self.helper()
        return self.x < len(self.vec)

```
