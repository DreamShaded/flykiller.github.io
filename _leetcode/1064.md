tags: [array, binary search]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/fixed-point/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/fixed-point/

#### Solution
One way is to use linear search.

There is better solution with binary search: we need to check the place where `A[x] - x == 0`. Notice, that `A[x] - x` sequence is non-decreasing. If we have `A[mid] - mid < 0`, it means that we can not use the left half with `mid` including, so we put `beg = mid + 1`, in the opposite case put `end = mid`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def fixedPoint(self, A):
        beg, end = 0, len(A) - 1
        
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end) // 2
            if A[mid] - mid < 0:
                beg = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid
        return beg if A[beg] == beg else -1
```
