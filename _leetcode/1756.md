#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-most-recently-used-queue/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/design-most-recently-used-queue/

#### Solution
One way to solve this problem is to use sqrt decomposition: we split our list into `sqrt(n)` parts of size `sqrt(n)`. We will keep each part as deque. Each time we need to extract element we do the following:

1. Find the place of chunk `k1` and place inside chunk `k2`.
2. Delete this element from chunk.
3. For all the next chunks remove element from the beginning of chunk `i+1` to end of chunk `i`: exactly for this we need queue, not stack.
4. Finally, put element to the end of last chunk.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of init is `O(n)`. Then for each `fetch` we will do it in `O(sqrt(n))`: this time we need both to delete element from chunk and update all other chunks. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class MRUQueue:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.m = m = int(sqrt(n))
        arr = list(range(n+1))
        self.data = [deque(arr[i:i+m]) for i in range(1, n+1, m)]

    def fetch(self, k):
        k1, k2 = divmod(k - 1, self.m)
        elem = self.data[k1][k2]
        del self.data[k1][k2]
        
        for i in range(k1, len(self.data) - 1):
            tmp = self.data[i + 1].popleft()
            self.data[i].append(tmp)
            
        self.data[-1].append(elem)
        return elem
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(n log n)` time complextiy for initialization and `O(log n)` complexity for `fetch` solution, using SortedList library..

Alternatively there is solution with complexity `O(log(n+2000)^2)` for fetch using BIT (or segment tree): `create an array with size n+2000. each time we fetch a element, move that to the end of array. Binary search the position where there are exact k elements to the left`. It can be improved to `O(log(n+2000))`
