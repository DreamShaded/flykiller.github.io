#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/super-ugly-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/super-ugly-number/

#### Solution 1
First solution is extension of problem **0264**, but now we need to keep not 3 pointers, but `k` of them.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(nk)`, space is `O(k)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def nthSuperUglyNumber(self, n, primes):
        k = len(primes)
        starts, nums = [0] * k, [1]
        for i in range(n-1):
            candidates = [primes[i]*nums[starts[i]] for i in range(k)]
            new_num = min(candidates)
            nums.append(new_num)
            starts = [starts[i] + (candidates[i] == new_num) for i in range(k)]
        return nums[-1]
```

#### Solution 2
Previous solution can improved to `O(n log k)`, if we use heap to maintain all indexes in our heap with tuples `(p*u, p, i)`, where `p*u` is the smallest value divisible by `p`, such that it is not traversed yet. We can look at it at merge of `k` lists, where each time we choose the smallest element.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log k)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def nthSuperUglyNumber(self, n, primes):
        cand = [(p, p, 1) for p in primes]
        ugly = [1]
        for _ in range(n-1):
            ugly.append(cand[0][0])
            while cand[0][0] == ugly[-1]:
                x, p, i = heappop(cand)
                heappush(cand, (p*ugly[i], p, i+1))
        return ugly[-1]
```
