title: Leetcode 1062 Longest Repeating Substring
tags: [string, dp, rolling hash]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-substring/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-substring/

#### Solution
Actually, this problem is simple case of **1044. Longest Duplicate Substring**, here constraints are smaller. We can use rolling hash algorithm with `O(n log n)` complexity, but it is enough to have `dp` with `dp(i, j)` be an answer to question: what is the length of maximum substrings ending with places `i` and `j`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` both for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestRepeatingSubstring(self, s):
        n, ans = len(s), 0
        dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(1, i):
                if s[i-1] == s[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
                    ans = max(ans, dp[i][j])

        return ans
```
