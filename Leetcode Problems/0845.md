title: Leetcode 0845. Longest Mountain in Array
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0845/
---

Let us traverse our numbers and keep two variables: `state` and `length`, where:
1. `state` is current state of our mountain: it is `0` in the beginning and also means that we can not start our mountain from given index. `state` equal to `1` means, that we are on increasing phase of our mountain and `state` equal `2` means, that we are on decreasing phase of our mountain.
2. `length` is current length of mountain built so far.

Now, we need to carefully look at our states and see what we need to do in one or another situation:
1. If `state` is equal to `0` or `1` and next element is more than current, it means we can continue to build increasing phase of mountain: so, we put `state` equal to `1` and increase `length` by `1`.
2. If `state` is equal to `2` and next element is more then curren, it means, that previous mountain just finished and we are currently buildind next mountain, for examle in `0,1,0,2,0`: first mountain is `0,1,0` and second is `0,2,0`. In this case we already build `2` elements of new mountain (mountains have `1` common element), so we put `length = 2` and `state = 1`.
3. If `state` is equal to `1` or `2` and next element is less than current, it means that we are on the decreasing phase of mountain: we put `state = 2` and also increase `length` by `1`. Note, that only here we need to update `max_len`, because our mountain is legible on this stage.
4. Finally, if we have some other option: it is either next element is equal to current, or we have state `0` and next element is less than previous, we need put our `state` and `length` to values as we just started.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, we make one pass over data, space complexity is `O(1)`.

class Solution:
    def longestMountain(self, A):
        n, max_len = len(A), 0
        state, length = 0, 1
        for i in range(n-1):
            if state in [0, 1] and A[i+1] > A[i]:
                state, length = 1, length + 1
            elif state == 2 and A[i+1] > A[i]:
                state, length = 1, 2
            elif state in [1, 2] and A[i+1] < A[i]:
                state, length = 2, length + 1
                max_len = max(length, max_len)
            else:
                state, length = 0, 1
                
        return max_len
