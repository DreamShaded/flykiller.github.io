#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/matchsticks-to-square/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/matchsticks-to-square/

#### Solution
Special case of Problem **698** Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets, but here we need to partition into 4 equal sums, we say, put them into `buckets` (or sides of square).

Please also check my post https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1125779/Dynamic-programming-on-subsets-with-examples-explained for more problems which can be solved with this technique.

Denote by `dp(mask)` possibility to put numbers from bitmask `mask` into say `k` subsets, such that sum inside each of the first `k-1` subsets is equal to `basket` . In more detais: we return -1 if this partition is not possible and we return `t >= 0`, if it is possible, where `t` is remainder when we divide sum of all used numbers so far by basket: value, of how many we need to put in each group. Given our `mask` there is several options about what matchstick can be taken the last: the places, where we meet `1` bit. So, if `neib` is answer for smaller problem with this match removed `dfs(mask ^ 1<<j)`, and `neib >= 0`, that is solution exists, and `neib + nums[j] <= basket`, that is we still have place in the last backet, then we return `(neib + nums[j]) % basket`. We use `%` here, because basked can be filled fully and in this case we need to start new one.

#### Complexity
We have `O(2^n)` states with `O(n)` transactions for each one, so overall time complexity is `(2^n * n)` and space complexity is `O(2^n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def makesquare(self, nums):
        N = len(nums)
        basket, rem = divmod(sum(nums), 4)
        if rem or max(nums) > basket: return False
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(mask):
            if mask == 0: return 0
            for j in range(N):
                if mask & 1<<j:
                    neib = dfs(mask ^ 1<<j)
                    if neib >= 0 and neib + nums[j] <= basket:
                        return (neib + nums[j]) % basket
            return -1
                    
        return dfs((1<<N) - 1) == 0
```
