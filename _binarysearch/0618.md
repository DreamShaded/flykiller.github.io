#### Solution
Just do what is asked with two pointers.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, node):
        head, curr = node, node
        while curr:
            last, cnt = curr, 0
            while cnt < last.val and curr:
                curr = curr.next
                cnt += 1
            last.next = curr
        return head
```
