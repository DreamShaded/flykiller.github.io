title: Leetcode 0111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0111/
---

All we need to do in this problem is traverse our graph with dfs or bfs and collect information about nodes depths. Let us use axuilary function `dfs` and:

1. If we reached `None`, then we return infinity.
2. If we reached leaf, then we return `1`, depth of our leaf
3. Finally, for node we return minumum of its children depths plus `1`. Note, that if one of the children is not exist, then is value for its depth will be infinity, so in fact we consider only existing children.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`. 

**PS** Do not be afraid, that this code is only faster than `5%` of submissions: the reason is that tests were updated resently and results of time distributions are not relevant.

```python
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root):
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return float("inf")
            if not node.left and not node.right: return 1
            return min(dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right)) + 1
        
        res = dfs(root)
        return res if res != float("inf") else 0
```
