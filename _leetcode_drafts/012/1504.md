#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-submatrices-with-all-ones/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-submatrices-with-all-ones/

#### Solution
This problem is similar to Leetcode 0085. Maximal Rectangle, but now we need to find not the biggest rectangle, but number of rectangles. We still can use the idea of monotonic deque here.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numSubmat(self, M):
        m, n, res = len(M), len(M[0]), 0
        H = [0]*(n + 1)
        for i in range(m):
            stack, dp = [-1], [0]*(n+1)
            for j in range(n):
                H[j] = M[i][j] * (H[j] + 1)
                while H[j] < H[stack[-1]]: stack.pop()
                dp[j] = dp[stack[-1]] + H[j]*(j - stack[-1])
                stack += [j]
            res += sum(dp)
        return res
```

#### Remark
There is easier `O(mn*min(m,n))` time complexity solution, using dp.
