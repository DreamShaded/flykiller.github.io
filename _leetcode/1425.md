#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/constrained-subsequence-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/constrained-subsequence-sum/

#### Solution
This problem is very similar to **1696**. Jump Game VI, but here we can say we can skip some jumps, so we can reuse code for 1696 but instead of `nums[i] += nums[deq[0]]` we use `nums[i] += max(0, nums[deq[0]])`

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, nums, k):
        deq, n = deque([0]), len(nums)

        for i in range(1, n):
            while deq and deq[0] < i - k: deq.popleft()
            nums[i] += max(0, nums[deq[0]])   
            while deq and nums[i] >= nums[deq[-1]]: deq.pop()
            deq.append(i)
            
        return max(nums)
```

#### Remark
There are alternative ways to solve it: using heap with lazy updates or bst, using `dp[i] = nums[i] + max(0, dp[i-k], dp[i-k+1], ..., dp[i-1])`
