title: Leetcode 0930. Binary Subarrays With Sum
tags: [counter, accumulate, 2sum]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/

#### Solution
We can use cumulative sums and then it is equivalent to 2sum problem.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, A, S):
        cnt, ans = Counter([0]), 0
        for el in accumulate(A):
            ans += cnt[el - S]
            cnt[el] += 1
        return ans
```
