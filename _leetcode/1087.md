title: Leetcode 1087 Brace Expansion
tags: [string, parser]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/brace-expansion/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/brace-expansion/

#### Solution
We can split string by brackets and then further split it by commas, because we are given that we do not have nested brackets. Then we can use functionality of product. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity to create `t` is `O(n)`, but then we need to create answer as well. Potentially it can be upto `O(2^(n/5))` for the case with two letters in each brackets

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def expand(self, s):
        t = []
        parts = s.replace("{", "}").split("}")
        for part in parts:
            if not part: continue
            t.append(sorted(part.split(",")))

        return ["".join(x) for x in product(*t)]
```
