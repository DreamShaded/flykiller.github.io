#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Moo/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Moo/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0838. Push Dominoes.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, D):
        D = "L" + D + "R"
        n, prev, ans = len(D), 0, ""
        for i in range(1, n):
            diff = i - prev - 1
            if D[i] == "@": continue
            
            if D[i] == D[prev]:
                ans += D[i]*diff     
            elif D[i] == "L" and D[prev] == "R":
                m, d = divmod(diff, 2)
                ans += "R"*m + "@"*d + "L"*m
            else:
                ans += "@"*diff
                
            ans += D[i]
            prev = i
        
        return ans[:-1]
```
