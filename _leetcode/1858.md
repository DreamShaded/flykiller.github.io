tags: [trie, string, hash table]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-with-all-prefixes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-with-all-prefixes/

#### Solution
This problem is almost the same as **0720**. Longest Word in Dictionary but with differnt constraints.

One of the ways to solve this problem is to put all words to trie and then traverse it and check we have `end_node` everywhere in our path. `dfs(node)` will return the longest word, which start from `node`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity to create tree is `O(M)`, where `M` is total length of all words. More interesting question about `dfs`. I think it is also `O(M)` complexity, but I am not 100 percent sure. Space complexity is `O(M)`.

#### Code
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.end_node = 0

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        root = self.root
        for symbol in word:
            root = root.children.setdefault(symbol, TrieNode())
        root.end_node = 1

class Solution:
    def longestWord(self, words):
        trie = Trie()
        for word in words:
            trie.insert(word)
              
        def dfs(node):
            cands = []
            for symb in node.children:
                if node.children[symb].end_node == 1:
                    cands += [symb + dfs(node.children[symb])]
            if not cands: return ""
                    
            return min(cands, key = lambda x: (-len(x), x))
        
        return dfs(trie.root)
```

#### Remark
In fact lenght of candidate can not be more than `O(sqrt(M))`, and I think we can use this somehow.

### 1868 Product of Two Run-Length Encoded Arrays

[intervals, two pointers]

#### Solution
The idea of this problem is to:

1. Create `events1` and `events2` are distance from the beginning to starts of chunks: cumulative sums.
2. Then we use two pointers approach: on each step we look which event is closer. If it is from `E1`, we move `i` to the right, if it is from `E2`, we move `j` to the right and if they are equal, move both. Also we keep `right` is current pointe we reached. Also we need to check if `val` of previous chunk is not the same as current, if they are equal, update last chunk.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m + n)` both for time and space. In fact, complexity can not be improved, because in the end we can have upto `O(m + n)` chunks.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findRLEArray(self, E1, E2):
        events1 = list(accumulate(x for _, x in E1))
        events2 = list(accumulate(x for _, x in E2))
        E3 = []
        
        i, j, right = 0, 0, 0
        while i < len(events1) and j < len(events2):
            val = E1[i][0]*E2[j][0]
            right2 = min(events1[i], events2[j])
            freq = right2 - right
            right = right2
            i, j = i + (events1[i] <= events2[j]), j + (events1[i] >= events2[j])
            
            if E3 and E3[-1][0] == val:
                E3[-1][1] += freq
            else:
                E3 += [[val, freq]]
        
        return E3
```
