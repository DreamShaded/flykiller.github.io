#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-permutation-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-permutation-ii/

#### Solution
First we need to check if we can make palindrome at all. If we can, then create string with its first `half` and `mid` if we have odd number of elements. Then we can use problem **0047**. Permutations II to gemerate all permutations with repetitions. Or we can use `permutations` function in python which will generate all $n!$ permutations with repetitions, and then we take only unique ones.  

#### Complexity
It is $O(n!\cdot n)$, where $n$ is equal to `s.length//2`. Space complexity is the same.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def generatePalindromes(self, s):
        cnt = Counter(s)
        odds = sum(b%2 == 1 for a,b in cnt.items())
        if odds > 1: return []
        
        half = "".join(t*(cnt[t]//2) for t in cnt)
        mid = ""
        for t in cnt:
            if cnt[t] % 2 == 1: mid = t
        
        ans = set()
        for perm in permutations(half):
            tmp = "".join(perm)
            ans.add(tmp + mid + tmp[::-1])
                
        return ans
```
