#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/

#### Solution 1
We need to find place, for which difference between two adjacent element changes its sign, so we can just do binary search.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def peakIndexInMountainArray(self, arr):
        beg, end = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end) // 2
            if arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]:
                beg = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid
        return beg
```

#### Solution 2
There is also ternary search for the cases, when function is not discrete.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log n)`, in fact it is `O(log3 n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def peakIndexInMountainArray(self, arr):
        beg, end = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while end - beg > 2:
            mid1, mid2 = (2*beg + end)//3, (beg + 2*end)//3
            if arr[mid1] > arr[mid2]:
                end = mid2
            else:
                beg = mid1
                
        return beg + 1
```
