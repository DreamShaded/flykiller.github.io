#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/

#### Solution
Let `a, b, c` be the minimum costs we can have if we have `i`-th home painted as green, red and blue respectively. Then we just need to update this values on each step. If we have `green` for example, it means, that previous was `red` or `blue` and we need to choose minimum.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$, space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs):
        a, b, c = 0, 0, 0
        for x, y, z in costs:
            a, b, c = x + min(b, c), y + min(a, c), z + min(a, b)
            
        return min(a, b, c)
```
