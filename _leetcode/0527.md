#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/word-abbreviation/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/word-abbreviation/

#### Solution
We can have conflict, if we have equal first and last symbol and the same length. So, let us sort our `dic`, using key `(len(x), x[0], x[-1], x[1:-1])`. Now, let us traverse sorted list and for each pair of adjacent words, create abbreviations of this two words, updating `comm` value. For example, if we have words `abcdxxxz, abcexxxz, abcetyxz`, for word `abcexxxz` it have common prefix of size `3` with previous word and common prefix of size `4` with next word, so we need to use abbreviation `abcex2z`. In the end we traverse our list and check if abbreviation is built or not.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n * m)$, where `n` is number of words in `dic` and `m` is average size of word in `dic`. Space complexity is `O(nm)` to keep words in `d`.

#### Code
```python
from os.path import commonprefix

class Solution:
    def abbr(self, word, size):
        if len(word) - size <= 3: return word
        return word[:size + 1] + str(len(word) - size - 2) + word[-1]
    
    def wordsAbbreviation(self, dic):
        n = len(dic)
        dic_sorted = sorted(dic, key = lambda x: (len(x), x[0], x[-1], x[1:-1]))

        d = defaultdict(tuple)
        for i in range(1, n):
            w0 = dic_sorted[i-1]
            w1 = dic_sorted[i]

            if w1[0] == w0[0] and w1[-1] == w0[-1] and len(w1) == len(w0):
                comm = len(commonprefix([w1, w0])) 
                d[w1] = max(d[w1], (comm, self.abbr(w1, comm)))
                d[w0] = max(d[w0], (comm, self.abbr(w0, comm)))
                
        return [d[w][1] if w in d else self.abbr(w,0) for w in dic]
```

#### Remark
Instead of sorting words, we can use tries. Let us split data into groups, where inside each group we have the same starting, ending symbols and length. Then what we need to do inside each group is to find for each word the length of longest common prefix between this word and all other words, which can be done, using Tries. Note, that is not Longest Common Prefix problem, where we need to find common prefix for all strings. Here for each string, we need to return maximum of all length of common prefix between this string and each other.

I think complexity will be `O(mn)`, both time and space.
