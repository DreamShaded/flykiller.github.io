#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/split-bst/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/split-bst/

#### Solution
The idea here is to use recursion: if we have `V` which is more or equal to our value of root, then left subtree is untouched and we need to recursively run function tor right subtree. Then we need to reattach new children: `root.right = res[0]`: new right children of root should be left answer for right subtree. Then we update `res[0] = root` and return `res`. Exactly the same logic we use if `root.val > V`. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(h)`, where `h` is height of tree, space we can say `O(1)`, because we use existing nodes.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def splitBST(self, root, V):
        if not root: return [None, None]

        if root.val <= V:
            res = self.splitBST(root.right, V)
            root.right = res[0]
            res[0] = root
            return res
        else:
            res = self.splitBST(root.left, V)
            root.left = res[1]
            res[1] = root
            return res 
```
