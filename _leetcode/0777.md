title: Leetcode 0777 Swap Adjacent in LR String
tags: [string, math]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-adjacent-in-lr-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-adjacent-in-lr-string/

#### Solution
Actually, quite difficult problem! First, we need to find invariant/half-invariant in this problem:

1. Number of `L`, `R` and `X` should be the same in both words.
2. When we delete all `X` symbols, the order of the rest `L` and `R` must be the same.
3. Moreover, each `L` letter can be moved only to the left and each `R` symbol can be moved to the right.

Moreover there `3` conditions not only sufficient but enough! We can see at this string as bunch of people which can be moved only to the left `L`, only to the right `R` and vacant places `X`.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def canTransform(self, start, end):
        if [s for s in start if s != "X"] != [s for s in end if s != "X"]: return False
        
        A = [(s, idx) for idx, s in enumerate(start) if s in "LR"]
        B = [(e, idx) for idx, e in enumerate(end) if e in "LR"]
    
        for (s, i), (e, j) in zip(A, B):
            if s == "L":
                if i < j:
                    return False
            if s == "R":
                if i > j:
                    return False
                
        return True
```
