[dp, greedy]

The idea is always make moves (x, y) -> (x+y, y) or (x, y) -> (x, x+y) (or +1 if we have bonus). Also on each level if we have say (1, 3) and (2, 5) we keep only the biggest one. There are at least two ways to get AC. 

1. Just traverse each layer and filter small pairs.

from itertools import permutations
 
def solve(m, n, arr):
    level = [(1, 1)]
 
    for i in range(max(m, n) + 1):
        l2 = []
        for x, y in level:
            if x >= m and y >= n: return i
            delta = (x, y) in arr
            l2 += [(min(x+y+delta, m), y), (x, min(x+y+delta, n))]
        
        l2 = set(l2)
        l3 = l2
        for (x1, y1), (x2, y2) in permutations(l2, 2):
            if x1 <= x2 and y1 <= y2: l2.discard((x1, y1))
 
        level = list(l3)
        
m, n = map(int, input().split())
r = int(input())
arr = set()
for _ in range(r):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    arr.add((x, y))
 
print(solve(m, n, arr))

2. For each i keep dp[i] the maximum value for pairs, such that second element is i, that is we have pair (i, dp[i]). This approach will lead to O(m log m + n) complexity: there will be O(log m+n/m) steps with O(m) complexity for each step. Notice, that if we change n and m, we will have O(log n + n/m) * O(n) steps, which will lead to TLE, so we need to take n >= m.

n, m = map(int, input().split())

r = int(input())
arr = set()
for _ in range(r):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    arr.add((x, y) if n < m else (y, x))

if n > m: n, m = m, n
 
def solve(m, n, arr):
    dp = [-1]*(n+1)
    dp[1] = 1
    result = 0
    while dp[n] != m:
        dp2 = dp[:]
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if dp[i] == -1: continue
            x = i + dp[i] + ((i, dp[i]) in arr)
            x_m, x_n = min(x, m), min(x, n)
            dp2[i] = max(dp2[i], x_m)
            dp2[x_n] = max(dp2[x_n], dp[i])
        dp = dp2
        result += 1
    return result

print(solve(m, n, arr))
