#### Problem statement

#### Solution
Let us sort intervals by starts.

The idea is to have dynamic programming with state `dp(i, taken)`, where `i` is index from what we allowed to take our intervals and `taken` is number of taken intervals. Then:
1. `if taken > k`, it means that we take more than we can, return `-inf`
2. `if i == len(E)`, it means that we reached the end: we return `0`.
3. Finally we have two choices: or we take `i`-th interval, then next interval we can take can be found with binary search: we need to find idex of interval, which `>= E[i][i] + 1`. Or we can not take it, then we just go to the next index.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*k*log(n))`, space complexity is `O(nk)`, where `n = len(E)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxValue(self, E, k):
        E = sorted(E)
        starts = [e[0] for e in E]
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, taken):
            if taken > k: return -inf
            if i == len(E): return 0
            temp = bisect_left(starts, E[i][1] + 1)
            return max(E[i][2] + dp(temp, taken + 1), dp(i+1, taken))
        
        return dp(0, 0)
```
