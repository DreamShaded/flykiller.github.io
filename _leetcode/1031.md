#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-two-non-overlapping-subarrays/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-two-non-overlapping-subarrays/

#### Solution
There is `O(n^2)` solution, which pass given constraints. However we can do better.
1. First of all, there is two cases, when interval of length `L` is befor `M` and the opposite.
2. Let us fix interval of length `L`. Then what choice we have for `M` if it is to the right of `L`?

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSumTwoNoOverlap(self, A, L, M):
        def maxSum(L, M):
            lft = [acc[i] - acc[i-L] for i in range(L, n + 1 - M)]
            lft = list(accumulate(lft, max))
            rgh = [acc[i+M] - acc[i] for i in range(L, n + 1 - M)]
            rgh = list(accumulate(rgh[::-1], max))[::-1]
            return max(x + y for x, y in zip(lft, rgh))

        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(A))
        n = len(A)
        return max(maxSum(L, M), maxSum(M, L))
```
