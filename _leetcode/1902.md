#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/depth-of-bst-given-insertion-order/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/depth-of-bst-given-insertion-order/

#### Solution
The idea is to keep `SortedList` object with tuples `(num, depth)`. Imagine, that `order = [3,1,2,4,5]`, then we have steps:

1. `[(3, 1)]`
2. `[(1, 2), (3, 1)]`
3. `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)]`
4. `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 2)]`
5. `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3)]`

On each step we look at left closest and right closest element, choose maximum among them and add `1`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class Solution:
    def maxDepthBST(self, order):
        SList, ans = SortedList(), 1
        ans = 1
        
        for num in order:
            ind = SList.bisect((num, 0))
            d = 0
            if ind > 0: d = max(d, SList[ind-1][1])
            if ind < len(SList): d = max(d, SList[ind][1])
            SList.add((num, d + 1))
            ans = max(ans, d + 1)
        
        return ans
```

#### Remark
I think it can be solved with segment tree or binary indexed tree as well with the same complexity.
