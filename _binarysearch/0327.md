#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Leaves-in-Same-Level/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Leaves-in-Same-Level/

#### Solution
Just traverse tree with dfs/bfs and when we have leaf, add its depths to set `l`. In the end check if it has only one element.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, root):
        l = set()
        def dfs(node, d):
            if not node: return
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                l.add(d)
            dfs(node.left, d + 1)
            dfs(node.right, d + 1)

        dfs(root, 0)
        return len(l) == 1
```
