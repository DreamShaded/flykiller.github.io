#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4-ii-call-multiple-times/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4-ii-call-multiple-times/

#### Solution
This problem is extension of problem **0157**. The difference here is that we need to keep global `self.buf`, because on the next call we still can have unused symbols inside. So, we have:
1. `self.buf` is buffer with `4` elements.
2. `self.curr` is variable that indicates on which index in `self.buf` we currently on.
3. `self.size` is total number of elements in buffer we have.

Let us consider function `read` now:
1. We start with `pl = 0`.
2. Iterate until we have `pl < n` and do the following steps:
3. If we do not have any more elements in buffer to use, we need to update buffer, using function `read4`.
4. If we have size of buffer equal to `0`, we break immedietly and return `pl`.
5. Next, we check how many elements we can take from buffer: no more than `self.size - self.curr` and also no more than `n - pl`, so we take minimum of them.
6. Update `buf` with corresponding elements from `self.buf`, update `pl` and `self.curr`.
7. Check if `self.curr` becomes equal to `self.size`: it means that we need to update buffer, so put `self.curr = 0`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m = n_1 + \dots + n_k$, sizes of queries. Space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buf = [""] * 4
        self.curr = 0
        self.size = 0
    
    def read(self, buf, n):
        pl = 0
        while pl < n:
            if self.curr == 0: self.size = read4(self.buf)
            
            if self.size == 0: break
            k = min(n - pl, self.size - self.curr)
            buf[pl:pl+k] = self.buf[self.curr: self.curr + k]
            pl += k
            self.curr += k
           
            if self.curr == self.size: self.curr = 0
                
        return pl
```
