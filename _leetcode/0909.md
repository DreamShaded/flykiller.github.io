#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/

#### Solution
The idea is to use bfs, because we are asked to find the shortest distance. First of all we need to create list `l` of correct order of cells. Then we use classical bfs, where step is either move from `1` to `6` where we check that if new position have ladder or snake, we need to go to new position. Also we can have loops, so we use `visited` set to avoid infinite loop.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def snakesAndLadders(self, board):
        l = [0]
        for i, row in enumerate(board[::-1]):
            l += row[::1 - (i%2)*2]
        
        n = len(board)    
        queue = deque([(0, 1)])
        visited = set([1])
        
        while queue:
            steps, pos = queue.popleft()
            if pos == n*n: return steps
            
            for i in range(pos + 1, min(pos + 7, n*n + 1)):
                cand = i if l[i] == -1 else l[i]
                if cand not in visited:
                    queue.append((steps + 1, cand))
                    visited.add(cand)

        return -1
```
