<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Missing-Numbers-From-1-to-N/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Missing-Numbers-From-1-to-N/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0448 Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, additional space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        for num in nums:
            nums[(num-1) % n] += n
            
        return [i+1 for i in range(n) if nums[i] <= n]
```
