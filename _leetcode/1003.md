tags: [stack]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-word-is-valid-after-substitutions/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-word-is-valid-after-substitutions/

#### Solution
We need to use stack: when we have `a b c` in the end of stack, remove it while we can.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s):
        stack = []
        for x in s:  
            stack += [x]
            while len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ["a", "b", "c"]:
                for _ in range(3): stack.pop()
            
        return not stack
```
