title: Leetcode 0874 Walking Robot Simulation
tags: [simulation]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/walking-robot-simulation/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/walking-robot-simulation/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked, keep `pl` is position of robot and `dr` is direction of robot. On each step we either change direction or move.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(k + n)`, where `k` is total number of steps of robot (one cell steps) and `n` is number of obstacles. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def robotSim(self, commands, obstacles):
        pl, dr, ans = (0, 0), (0, 1), 0
        obst_set = {(x, y) for x, y in obstacles}
        
        for comm in commands:
            if comm == -1: 
                dr = (dr[1], -dr[0])
            elif comm == -2: 
                dr = (-dr[1], dr[0])
            else:
                for j in range(comm):
                    new_pl = (pl[0] + dr[0], pl[1] + dr[1])
                    if new_pl not in obst_set:
                        pl = new_pl
                        ans = max(ans, pl[0]**2 + pl[1]**2)
                    else:
                        break
        
        return ans
```
