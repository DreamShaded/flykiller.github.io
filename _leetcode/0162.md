#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/

#### Solution
There is a huge hint given in the problem description: we need to find solution with complexity `O(log n)` and we immedietly must think about **binary search**. Let us consider the case `[-inf, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4, inf]`. We need to find place `k`, such that `nums[k] < nums[k+1]` and `nums[k+1] > nums[k+2]`. Let us compare all pairs of adjacent elements and ask question: if the first one is smaller then the second, for our array we have `[True, True, False, True, True, True, False, False]`. Then what we need to find in this array is any two adjacent places where we have pair `True, False`. Note, that first element is always `True` and last is always `False`, so we have `True, .............., False`. 

Now, let us choose element in the middle, and we can have two options:
1) It is `True`, so we have `True, ......, True, ......., False` and in this case for the second half we have property that it starts with `True` and ends with `False`.
2) It is `False`, so we have `True, ......, False, ......., False` and in this case for the first half we have property that it starts with `True` and ends with `False`.

So, in any case we save the property that it starts with `True` and ends with `False`. Each time we decrease length of interal twice, so:

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums):
        beg, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
                beg = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid

        return end
```
