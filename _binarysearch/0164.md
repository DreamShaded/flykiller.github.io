#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Kth-Smallest-Element/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Kth-Smallest-Element/

#### Solution
Variation of Leetcode 0215. Kth Largest Element in an Array, but we need to find smaller here, and index starts with `0`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` in average

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        pivot = random.choice(nums)
        left =  [x for x in nums if x < pivot]
        mid  =  [x for x in nums if x == pivot]
        right = [x for x in nums if x > pivot]
        
        L, M = len(left), len(mid)
        
        if k < L:
            return self.solve(left, k)
        elif k >= L + M:
            return self.solve(right, k - L - M)
        else:
            return mid[0]
```
