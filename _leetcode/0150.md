title: Leetcode 0150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
tags: [stack, math]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/

#### Solution
This problem is ideal for recursion or stack. All we need to do is to understand logic: if we see new number, put it into stack, if we see operation, extract the last two numbers and apply this operation. Also be careful with shrinking towards zero: I spent some time before realized that it is just `int(b/a)` meant here.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is just `O(n)`, because we can put an remove each element from stack only once. Potentially we can have upty `n//2` elements in our stack.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens):
        stack = []
        def f(a, b, c):
            if c == "+": return a+b
            if c == "-": return b-a
            if c == "*": return a*b
            if c == "/": return int(b/a)
            
        for token in tokens:
            if token in "*/+-":
                stack.append(f(stack.pop(), stack.pop(), token))
            else:
                stack.append(int(token))
        return stack[-1]
```
