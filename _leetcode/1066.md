#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/campus-bikes-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/campus-bikes-ii/

#### Solution
Straightforward bit-dp problem, where `dp(mask, i)` means that we have `mask` of avaliable bikes and `i` is index of current worker we want to distribute bike to. To evaluate value we need to check all non-zero bytes in `mask` and check value `dist(W[i], B[j]) + dp(mask^(1<<j), i-1)` for them.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(2^m*m)`, because we have at most `2^m` states: even though we have `(mask, i)`, in fact number of non-zero bits in `mask` minus `i` is constant (equal to `m-n+1`). And we have `O(m)` transactions from one state to others. Space complexity is `O(2^m)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def assignBikes(self, W, B):
        def dist(A, B):
            return abs(A[0] - B[0]) + abs(A[1] - B[1])

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(mask, i):
            if i == -1: return 0
            return min(dist(W[i], B[j]) + dp(mask^(1<<j), i-1) for j in range(m) if (mask>>j) & 1)

        n, m = len(W), len(B)
        return dp((1<<m)-1, n-1)

```
