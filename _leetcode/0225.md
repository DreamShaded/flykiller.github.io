#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/

#### Solution
Let us use 2 queues. When we push we put element to the right of queue `q1`. When we pop, we first extract elements from `q1` and put them to `q2`. Then we extract one more element `out = q1.popleft()` and change places of our queues, finally we return `out`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity for pop is `O(n)`, for other operations complexity is `O(1)`. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class MyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q1, self.q2 = deque(), deque()
        self._top = None
        
    def push(self, x):
        self.q1.append(x)
        self._top = x
        
    def pop(self):
        while len(self.q1) > 1:
            self._top = self.q1.popleft()
            self.q2.append(self._top)
            
        out = self.q1.popleft()
        self.q1, self.q2 = self.q2, self.q1
        return out
        
    def top(self):
        return self._top

    def empty(self):
        return not self.q1
```

#### Remark
We can actually use only one queue with the same complexities, we put this element to our queue and then rotate it `n` times: pop and push to itself. However there is no solution with `O(1)` complexities for all operations.
