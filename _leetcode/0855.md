#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/exam-room/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/exam-room/

#### Solution
There is straightforward solution with `O(n)` complexity to `seat` and `leave`, we just keep sorted list and find shortest distance. However we can do better: let us have:

1. `self.places` are occupied places, we keep them in SortedList python object
2. `self.scores` are segments between two adjacent persons with scores: imagine, that we have people on places `[-1, 4, 9, 12]`, where `n = 12` (we use two dummy seats: `-1` and `n`). Then we have `3` possible segments where we can seat people: `[-1, 4]` and score here is `4`, because putting person on seat `0` it will be `4` seats away from any other one. Next segment is `[4, 9]` and we have score `2` here, if we put new person on seat `6`. Finally, for segment `[9, 12]` score is 2, because we can put person on seat number `11`. In the beginning we create one segment `[-1, n]` and its score.
3. `priority` function will evaluate score of segment, here we need to deal with two cases: when we are in the middle or not.
4. `seat` function will work like this: first, we found the biggest element from `self.scores`, it will be the segment we need to seat person to. Then, if left end of this segment is `-1`, we need to seat person on place `0`, if right end is `n`, we need to seat person on place `n - 1`, in other case we seat him in the middle. We also add two new segments to `self.scores`, one place to `self.places` and return `mid`.
5. `leave` Let us find index of person we need to delete, find its neighbours, delete one segment and add two new segments from to `self.scores` and remove place from `self.places`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of both operations is `O(log n)`, where `n` is current number of occupied seats.

#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class ExamRoom:
    def __init__(self, N):
        self.N = N
        self.places = SortedList([-1, N])
        self.scores = SortedList()
        self.priority(-1,N,SortedList.add)
        
    def priority(self, beg, end, func): 
        if beg == -1 or end == self.N:
            score = beg - end + 1
        else:
            score = -((end - beg) // 2)
        func(self.scores, (score, beg, end))
        
    def seat(self):
        _, beg, end  = self.scores.pop(0)
        
        if beg == -1:
            mid = beg + 1
        elif end == self.N:
            mid = end - 1
        else:
            mid = (beg + end) // 2

        self.priority(beg, mid, SortedList.add)
        self.priority(mid, end, SortedList.add)
    
        self.places.add(mid)
        return mid

    def leave(self, p):
        ind = self.places.index(p)
        beg, end = self.places[ind-1], self.places[ind+1]
        
        self.priority(beg, end, SortedList.add)
        self.priority(beg, p, SortedList.remove)
        self.priority(p, end, SortedList.remove)
        
        self.places.remove(p)
```

#### Remark
There is alternative solution with the same complexity, using heaps with **lazy** updates. We need to keep tuples of four elements: last one is flag if this segment deleted or not. Also we need to keep dictionary (or two dictionaries), which connects each point to left and right segments.
