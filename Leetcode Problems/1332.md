title: Leetcode 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1332/
---

Please note, that we deal with **subsequence**, not subarrays, so we can delete any amount of symbols on each step, not only adjacent ones!

There can be basically `3` different answers for this problem:

1. We return `0`, if string is already empty, we do not need to do anything.
2. If string is palindrome itself and it is not empty, we return `1`.
3. Finally, if two previous cases are not true, we can first delete all letters `a` and then all letters `b`, so we return `2`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, we need to check if the string is palindrome. Space complexity is `O(n)`, because here I create `s[::-1]` string, which can be reduced to `O(1)` space.

```
class Solution:
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s):
        return 0 if s == "" else 1 if s==s[::-1] else 2
```
