#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/previous-permutation-with-one-swap/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/previous-permutation-with-one-swap/

#### Solution
We need to find two places `i` and `j`, such that:
1. `arr[i] > arr[j]`
2. `i` is as right as possible.
3. We look for the biggest digit smaller than `arr[i]` to the right of `i`.
3. For fixed digit we want to have the rightest place.

So we traverse from the end, for each digit keeping the leftest index so far. For each place `i` we look for digit smaller than `arr[i]` and we start from biggest digits first.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n * 10)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def prevPermOpt1(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        d = {}
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            d[arr[i]] = i
            for dig in range(arr[i] - 1, -1, -1):
                if dig in d:
                    arr[i], arr[d[dig]] = arr[d[dig]], arr[i]
                    return arr
                
        return arr
```
