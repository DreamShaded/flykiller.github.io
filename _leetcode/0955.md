title: Leetcode 0955. Delete Columns to Make Sorted II
tags: [greedy, string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-columns-to-make-sorted-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-columns-to-make-sorted-ii/

#### Solution
Let us work in greedy strategy: go from the first element and check if we have some break of order. We keep `unsorted` set is the set of indexes `x`, such that we do not have row `x` smaller than row `x + 1` yet.

1. If we have some break of order, we need to remove this column and add it to answer.
2. If we do not have break of order, we have two options: `A[i][j] = A[i + 1][j]` or `A[i][j] < A[i + 1][j]`. In the first case we do not have sorted yet. In the second we now know that this pair is sorted, so we remove it from set. 

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletionSize(self, A):
        res, n, m = 0, len(A), len(A[0])
        unsorted = set(range(n - 1))
        for j in range(m):
            if any(A[i][j] > A[i + 1][j] for i in unsorted):
                res += 1
            else:
                unsorted -= {i for i in unsorted if A[i][j] < A[i + 1][j]}
        return res
```
