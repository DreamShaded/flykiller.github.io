title: Leetcode 1272 Remove Interval
tags: [intervals, array, binary search]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-interval/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-interval/

#### Solution
What we need to do is to traverse our intervals for for each of them find this interval with removed part. We need to carefully check cases.

1. if `A[1] < R[0]` or `A[0] > R[1]`, then we do not have intersection, remove original interval.
2. if `A[0] < R[0]`, it means that we have part of interval in the left side.
3. if `A[1] > R[1]`, then we have part of interval in the right side.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def removeInterval(self, intervals, R):
        def remove(A, R):
            if A[1] < R[0]: return [A]
            if A[0] > R[1]: return [A]
            ans = []
            if A[0] < R[0]: ans += [[A[0], R[0]]]
            if A[1] > R[1]: ans += [[R[1], A[1]]]
            return ans
            
        ans = []
        for I in intervals:
            ans += remove(I, R)
                
        return ans
```

### 1273 Delete Tree Nodes

[dfs, tree, recursion]

#### Solution
We need to pefrom dfs with `3` parameters in answer:
1. Sum of all nodes in subtree with `node` as root.
2. Number of nodes in this subtree.
3. Number of nodes we need to delete.

Then, when we perform postorder dfs, if we have:
1. `sm + value[node] == 0`, it means, that all this subtree need to be delted, so return `(0, cnt + 1, cnt + 1)`, that is delet all nodes.
2. If it is not equal, return `(sm + value[node], cnt + 1, dl)`, where `dl` is sum of how many nodes we need to delete for each children.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def deleteTreeNodes(self, n, parent, value):
        G = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(n):
            G[parent[i]] += [i]
            
        def dfs(node):
            sm, cnt, dl = 0, 0, 0
            for child in G[node]:
                sm2, cnt2, dl2 = dfs(child)
                sm += sm2
                cnt += cnt2
                dl += dl2
            
            if sm + value[node] == 0:
                return (0, cnt + 1, cnt + 1)
            else:
                return (sm + value[node], cnt + 1, dl)
            
        return n - dfs(0)[2]
```
