#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-path-quality-of-a-graph/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-path-quality-of-a-graph/

#### Solution
Key to success in this problem is to read problem constraints carefully: I spend like 10 minutes before I understand that problem can be solved using very simple dfs. Why? Because it is given that `maxTime <= 100` and `time_j >= 10`. It means that we can make no more than `10` steps in our graph! So, all we need to do is to run `dfs(node, visited, gain, cost)`, where:

1. `node` is current node we are in.
2. `visited` is set of visited nodes: we need to keep set, because we count visitet nodes only once.
3. `gain` is total gain we have so far.
4. `cost` is how much time we still have.

#### Complexity
We have at most `10` steps, and it is also given that each node have at most degree `4`, so in total we can make no more than `4^10` states. That is why we will not get TLE.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maximalPathQuality(self, values, E, maxTime):
        G = defaultdict(list)
        for x, y, w in E:
            G[x].append((y, w))
            G[y].append((x, w))
            
        def dfs(node, visited, gain, cost):
            if node == 0: self.ans = max(self.ans, gain)
            for neib, w in G[node]:
                if w <= cost:
                    dfs(neib, visited | set([neib]), gain + (neib not in visited) * values[neib], cost - w)

        self.ans = 0
        dfs(0, set([0]), values[0], maxTime)
        return self.ans
