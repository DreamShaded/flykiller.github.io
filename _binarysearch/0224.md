#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Pythagorean-Triplets/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Pythagorean-Triplets/

#### Solution
For each pair of elements find its sum of squares and check if it is in set of squares.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        nset = set(x*x for x in nums)
        for x, y in product(nums, nums):
            if x*x + y*y in nset:
                return True
        return False
```
