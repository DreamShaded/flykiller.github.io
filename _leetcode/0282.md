#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/expression-add-operators/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/expression-add-operators/

#### Solution
Quite diffucult problem, which is similar to Basic Calculators problem (**0224**, **0227**). Let us consider `dfs` with the following parameters:

1. `idx` is the index of current element we traverse in `num`.
2. `path` is the string built so far.
3. `value` is current value of created path.
4. `last` is the value of the last monomial.

Here we use idea of stack of monomials: imagine, that we have expression `1*2 + 3*4*5`, then we have the following steps: `[1], [2], [2, 3], [2,12], [2,60]`: each time we have `+` or `-` we add one element to the end of stack; each time we have `*` we update the last element in stack.

Then when we traverse our string, we can have several options: each time we need to create `tmp = int(num[idx: i])` and make sure that this is valid number: `tmp` will be the next number we are going to use. Then if `last == None`, we have only one option. If `last != None`, we can have `3` options which symbol we can take: if it is `+` or `-`, we just update `value` and sign of `tmp`. If it is multiplication, we need to update both `value` and `last` should be multiplied by `tmp`.

#### Complexity
It is potentially `O(4^n * n)`, because on each step we have `4` options: `+`, `-`, `*` or no sign. Space complexity potentially the same.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def addOperators(self, num, target):
        def dfs(idx, path, value, last):            
            if idx == n and value == target:
                ans.append(path)
            
            for i in range(idx + 1, n + 1):
                tmp = int(num[idx: i])
                if i == idx + 1 or (i > idx + 1 and num[idx] != "0"):
                    if last is None :
                        dfs(i, num[idx: i], tmp, tmp)
                    else:
                        dfs(i, path + '+' + num[idx: i], value + tmp, tmp)
                        dfs(i, path + '-' + num[idx: i], value - tmp, -tmp)
                        dfs(i, path + '*' + num[idx: i], value - last + last*tmp, last*tmp)
        
        ans, n = [], len(num)
        dfs(0, "", 0, None)
        return ans
```
