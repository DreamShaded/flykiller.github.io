#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/camelcase-matching/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/camelcase-matching/

#### Solution
What we need to check for each pair `(q, pattern)` is:
1. If `q` is subsequence of `pattern`, reuse classical problem Leetcode 0392. Is Subsequence.
2. If number of capital letters in `q` and `pattern` is the same.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space, where `n` is the total length of all `queries`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def camelMatch(self, queries, pattern):
        def isSubsequence(s, t):
            t = iter(t)
            return all(c in t for c in s)
        
        ans, up_cnt = [], sum(i.isupper() for i in pattern)
        for q in queries:
            if not isSubsequence(pattern, q) or sum(i.isupper() for i in q) != up_cnt:
                ans += [False]
            else:
                ans += [True]
                
        return ans
```
