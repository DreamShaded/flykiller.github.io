#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Color-Map/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Color-Map/

#### Solution
We need to find connected components of graph, then for each color we need to know how many components of this color we have. In the end we will color all components to this color.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, M):
        if not M: return 0
        m, n = len(M), len(M[0])

        def dfs(x, y, c):
            if not 0 <= x < m or  not 0 <= y < n or M[x][y] == -1: return 

            if M[x][y] == c:
                M[x][y] = -1
                for dx, dy in [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]: 
                    dfs(x + dx, y + dy, c)

        d = Counter()
        for x in range(m):
            for y in range(n):
                if M[x][y] == -1: continue
                d[M[x][y]] += 1
                dfs(x, y, M[x][y])

        vals = list(d.values())
        return sum(vals) - max(vals)
```
