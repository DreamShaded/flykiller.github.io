#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Number-of-Unique-Binary-Search-Trees/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Number-of-Unique-Binary-Search-Trees/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0096. Unique Binary Search Trees, but here we need to compute given module.

#### Complexity
Here is `O(n^2)` time complexity solution.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        if n == 0: return 1
        dp = [0]*(n+1)
        dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            for j in range(1, i+1):
                dp[i] += dp[j-1] * dp[i-j]
            dp[i] %= (10**9 + 7)
        return dp[n]
```

#### Remark
It is possible to make it `O(n)` time as well.
