tags: [two pointers]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

#### Solution
It can be done with classical two pointers idea, slow-runner and fast-runner.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$, space is $O(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        slow, fast = 1, 1

        while fast < len(nums):
            if nums[slow - 1] != nums[fast]:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                slow += 1
            fast += 1
        return slow
```
