#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-division/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-division/

#### Solution 1
One of the possible solution is dp, where we have states `dfs(i, j, part}`, where `i` and `j` are start and end numbers and `part` equal to `0` or `1`, where `0` means we need to maximize value and `1` means that we need to minimize value. We need this `part` value, because we need maximize part in the left and minimize part in the right of division. Also we need to carefully deal brackets: we need them if we are in the right part and if length of this part is more than one.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^3)`, space complexity also `O(n^3)`, because each solution takes `O(n)` space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def optimalDivision(self, nums):
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i, j, part):           
            if i == j: return [nums[i], str(nums[i])]
            cand = [0, ""] if part == 0 else [float("inf"), ""]
            for k in range(i, j):
                part1 = dfs(i, k, part)
                part2 = dfs(k+1, j, 1-part)
                res_num = part1[0]/part2[0]
                left, right = part1[1], part2[1]
    
                if k-i == 0 and k+1 != j: right = "(" + right + ")"
                
                operators = [max, min]
                cand = operators[part](cand, [res_num, left + "/" + right])

            return cand
     
        return dfs(0, len(nums)-1, 0)[1]
```

#### Solution 2
There is smarter mathematical solution, where we note, that maximum will reach at point $a_1/(a_2/a_3/\dots a_n)$. So all we need to do is deal with $n=1$ and $n=2$ cases.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def optimalDivision(self, nums):
        A = list(map(str, nums))
        if len(A) <= 2: return '/'.join(A)
        return A[0] + '/(' + '/'.join(A[1:]) + ')'
```
