#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher-ii/

#### Solution
What we can note, that we always have period `6` in our data: so we can just consider first `6` bulbs. Then just let consider set of seen states and update it, there will be no more than `64` states. We use binary masks: `63 = 111111, 36 = 100100, 42 = 101010` and `21 = 010101` and then we cut last bits, using `>>(6-n)<<(6-n)` trick. 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def flipLights(self, n, m):
        if n > 6: n = 6
        states = set([0])
        mods = [21, 42, 36, 63]
        for i in range(m):
            states_new = set()
            for state, mod in product(states, mods):
                states_new.add(state^mod)
            if len(states) == len(states_new): break
            states = states_new
        
        return len(set([i>>(6-n)<<(6-n) for i in states]))
```

#### Remark
Actually, we can improve it and show that all state will be defined not by `6`, but by `3` first bulbs. Also we can just precalculate all options: 

1. If `n = 1`, then we have `1` status for `m = 0` and `2` for `m > 0`.
2. if `n = 2`, then we have answer `1` for `m = 0`, `3` for `m = 1` and `4` for `m > 1`.
3. if `n >= 3`, then we have `1` for `m = 0`, `4` for `m = 1`, `7` for `m = 2` and `8` for `m >= 3`.

Time and space complexity is `O(1)`.
