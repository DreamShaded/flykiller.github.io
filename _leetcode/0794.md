#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-tic-tac-toe-state/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-tic-tac-toe-state/

#### Solution
Let us evaluate several characteristic of our board: number of `O`, number of `X`, number of full lines with `X`, which we call `XXX` and also `OOO`. Then board can be valid only in two cases:

1. Number of `X` is one more than number of `O`, it means that last move was made by first: in this case `OOO` must be equal to zero and `XXX` should be less or equal than `2` (actually we do not need to check last condition)
2. Number of `X` is equal to number of `O`, it means, that last move was made be second: in this case `XXX` must be equal to zero and `OOO` should be less or equal to `1` (again no need to check it in fact)

#### Complexity
Overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`, where `n = 3` is size of our grid, space complexity is the same.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def validTicTacToe(self, board):
        line = "".join(board)
        fin = [[0,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8],[0,3,6],[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[0,4,8],[2,4,6]]
        XXX, OOO = 0, 0
        X, O = line.count("X"), line.count("O")
        
        for a,b,c in fin:
            XXX += (line[a] + line[b] + line[c] == "XXX")
            OOO += (line[a] + line[b] + line[c] == "OOO")
        
        if X - O == 1 and XXX <= 2 and OOO == 0: return True
        if X - O == 0 and OOO <= 1 and XXX == 0: return True
        
        return False
```
