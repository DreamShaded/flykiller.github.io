#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/

#### Solution
Just iterate over array and keep counting ones, until we reached zero, then set it to zero. We can look at this as sliding window approach also.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums):
        cur_max, gl_max = 0, 0
        for i in nums:
            if i == 1:
                cur_max += 1
                gl_max = max(gl_max, cur_max)
            else:
                cur_max = 0    
        return gl_max
```
