What we actually need to find in this problem is length of our number in bits: if we have `10 = 1010`, then complementary is `5 = 101`. Note, that `5 + 10 = 15 = 2^4 - 1`. So, let us just find length of our number in bits and subtract `N-1`.

**Complexity** time complexity is `O(log N)` to find its length; space complexity is also `O(log N)` to keep binary representation of our number.

```python
class Solution:
    def bitwiseComplement(self, N):
         return (1<<(len(bin(N)) - 2)) - 1 - N
```
