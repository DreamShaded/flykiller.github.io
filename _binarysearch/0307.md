#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Word-Formation-Sequel/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Word-Formation-Sequel/

#### Solution
Let us use counters here. Calculate `l1` is number of `*` symbols and `l2` is counter of the rest symbols. Then for each `w` in words, check difference of counters, and if it has `<= l1` elements, we can get this word.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time, where `n` is the total length of all words and `O(26)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, words, letters):
        l1 = letters.count("*")
        l2 = Counter([x for x in letters if x != "*"])
        ans = 0
        for w in words:
            if sum(x for x in (Counter(w) - l2).values()) <= l1:
                ans = max(ans, len(w))
        return ans
```
