#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Run-Length-Decoding/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Run-Length-Decoding/

#### Solution
Go symbol by symbol and if we have digit, update `num`, if we have letter, add this letter multiplied by `num`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m)` for time and space, where `m` is the length of answer.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        ans, num = [], ""
        for x in s:
            if x.isdigit():
                num += x
            else:
                ans += [x] * int(num)
                num = ""
        return "".join(ans)
```
