#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/all-possible-full-binary-trees/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/all-possible-full-binary-trees/

#### Solution
Let `trees[k]` be all full binary trees with `k` nodes. Then these trees can be constructed, using tree with `i` nodes for left child and with `k-i-1` nodes for right child. Note also, that only for odd `n` there exist full binary tree with `n` nodes.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $C_{(n-1)/2}\cdot n$ ($C_i$ is Catalan number), because it can be show that this number of trees exist. Space complexity is the same.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def allPossibleFBT(self, n):
        trees = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
        trees[1] = [TreeNode()]
        
        for k in range(n+1):  
            for i in range(1, k-1, 2):
                for left in trees[i]:
                    for right in trees[k - i - 1]:
                        root = TreeNode()
                        root.left = left
                        root.right = right
                        trees[k].append(root)
                        
        return trees[-1]
```
