tags: [stack, monotonic deque]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/

#### Solution
Similar to problem **0496** Next Greater Element I. Let us again keep not-increasing stack. Let us use the trick with duplication of array. Create `result = [-1]*n` and then iterate through duplicated array. We only update elements in `result` if we found next greater element, if we did not find it, it will remain equal to zero.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, because we put and remove from stack not more than `1` time, space complexity is `O(n)` for duplication of `nums`. 

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums):
        stack, n = [], len(nums)
        result = [-1]*n
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums + nums[:-1]):
            while stack and stack[-1][1] < num:
                a, b = stack.pop()
                result[a%n] = num
            stack.append((i, num))
        
        return result 
```
