title: Leetcode 1807. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1807/
---

Nothing very special about this problem, we need to traverse our string and deal with data inside brackets. Let us do it in the following way:

1. Create `d`: dictionary of knowledge
2. Split `s` into parts, using `(`. Imagine, that `s = (name)is(age)yearsold`, then splitted list will be `['', 'name)is', 'age)yearsold']`. It will look like this: first part will not have closing bracket, and each next part will have closing bracket.
3. So, we add `t[0]` to final solution and then for each next part we againg use split, now by ")" and check if we have first part in `d` or not: and either add `?` to answer or corresponding value. Also we add second part `b`, which goes after brackets.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(m + n)`, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the total length of all the words in `knowledge`: we created dictionary once and then we do one split with `O(n)` and then for each part we do another split and total length of all parts is `O(n)`. Space complexity is also `O(m+n)`.

```
class Solution:
    def evaluate(self, s, knowledge):
        d = {k:v for k, v in knowledge}
        t = s.split("(")
        ans = t[0]
        for i in range(1, len(t)):
            a, b = t[i].split(")")
            ans += d.get(a, "?") + b
        return ans
```
