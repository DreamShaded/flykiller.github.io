#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/

#### Solution
What we need to do in this problem is to perform usual schoolbook addition. We need to start to add numbers from the last elements and take care of carry and cases when one number has more digits that another. Imagine that we want to add two numbers: `986` and `47`. Then we have the followint steps:

1. Add `6` and `7`, so we have digit `3` and carry equal to `1`.
2. Add `8` and `4` and `1`, so we have `3` and carry equal to `1`.
3. Add `9` from first number, and we do not have anything from second, so we choose 0 from second. Also we have curry equal to `1`, finally we have digit `0` and carry equal to `1`.
4. We still have carry, but no digits left, so we evaluate `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`. And now we can stop, we do not have digits and we do not have carry.

Final number we constructed is `1033`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(m + n)`, where m and n are lengths of our linked lists, space complexity is `O(max(m, n))` if we count answer as memory or `O(1)` if we do not.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def addStrings(self, num1, num2):
        l1, l2, carry, ans = len(num1) - 1, len(num2) - 1, 0, []
        while l1 >= 0 or l2 >= 0 or carry:
            d1 = int(num1[l1]) if l1 >= 0 else 0
            d2 = int(num2[l2]) if l2 >= 0 else 0
            carry, digit = divmod(d1 + d2 + carry, 10)
            ans += [str(digit)]
            l1, l2 = l1 - 1, l2 - 1
        
        return "".join(ans[::-1])
```
