#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-string-is-transformable-with-substring-sort-operations/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-string-is-transformable-with-substring-sort-operations/

#### Solution
Quite difficult problem for me, because we need to use greedy approach here. There are couple of observations we need to deal with:

1. Instead of sorting substring, we can replace it by operation: given two adjacent elements `x > y`, swap them.
2. Imagine, we have `d.........` for the first string and `x........` for the second. Then we need to find the first `d` in the second string: `x[A]d[B]`, where `[A]` and `[B]` are some strings. Why we need to find the first occurrence? Because we can not swap elements with `x = y`. So, if we did not found the place to swap with, we return `False`. Also we need to make sure, that all elements in `x[A]` are smaller than `d`: again when we drag element `d` to the right, we need this condition.
3. What we keep is places: deque of places for each digit: in this way we can quickly check two conditions above.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isTransformable(self, s, t):
        s, t = [*map(int, s)], [*map(int, t)]
        places = [deque() for _ in range(10)]
        for i, dig in enumerate(s):
            places[dig].append(i)
        
        for dig in t:
            if not places[dig]:
                return False 
            i = places[dig][0]
            for j in range(dig):
                if places[j] and places[j][0] < i:
                    return False
            places[dig].popleft()
        return True
```
