#### Solution
To solve this problem we need to understand that this is recursion problem. We need two things to make it work fast:

1. For each closing bracket we need to find corresponding open bracket, we can do it with function `corr` with usual stack technique.

2. We need to solve `dp(beg, end)` problem recursively. Here what this function will return is tuple `(val, changes)`, where `val` is value before changing and `changes` is minumum number of changes we need to make to change `val`. There can be several different cases:
    
    2.1 We have structure like this `....?(...)`, where question mark can be either `&` or `|` and dots mean any symbols. Also it can happen that left dots are empty then we have case `(...)`

    2.2 We have string like this `...?n`, where `n` can be either `0` or `1` and question mark is again `|` or `&`. Also it can happen that dots are empty than we have `n` case.

When we run `dfs(beg, end)` we need:
1. Check if `beg == end`, then we have second case from case 2.2.
2. If last symbol is digit, then we recursively run function for left and right parts.
3. Also if last symbol is bracket and its corresponding symbol is starting brackets, then we have second case from 2.1 and we need to deal with it.

4. Finally, what we have in the end, are two values `p1, p2`: true values for left and right parts and operation `op`. Here for simplicity I check all `8` possible case, this is exactly what I did on contest.

```python
if p1 == 0 and p2 == 0 and op == "|": return (0, min(c1, c2))
if p1 == 1 and p2 == 0 and op == "|": return (1, 1)
if p1 == 1 and p2 == 1 and op == "|": return (1, 1 + min(c1, c2))
if p1 == 0 and p2 == 1 and op == "|": return (1, 1)
if p1 == 0 and p2 == 0 and op == "&": return (0, 1 + min(c1, c2))
if p1 == 1 and p2 == 0 and op == "&": return (0, 1)
if p1 == 1 and p2 == 1 and op == "&": return (1, min(c1, c2))
if p1 == 0 and p2 == 1 and op == "&": return (0, 1)
```

For example if we have  `0|0`, then what we can do is to change either left or right part to `1`, so minimum number of changes is `min(c1, c2)`. It can be written in shorter way, see code.

#### Complexity
Time complexity can be estimated as `O(n)`, because in fact for every valid substring we have we will call it once. Space complexity is `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperationsToFlip(self, E):
        def corr(s):
            stack, d = [], {}
            for i, elem in enumerate(s):
                if elem == "(":
                    stack.append(i)
                elif elem == ")":
                    last = stack.pop()
                    d[i] = last
            return d

        def dfs(beg, end):
            if beg == end: return (int(E[beg]) , 1)
            beg2 = d.get(end, end)
            if beg2 == beg: return dfs(beg + 1, end - 1)
            p1, c1 = dfs(beg, beg2 - 2)
            p2, c2 = dfs(beg2, end)
            op = E[beg2 - 1]
            
            t = {"|": lambda x, y:x|y, "&": lambda x, y:x&y}
            c3 = 1 if p1 + p2 == 1 else min(c1, c2) + (p1^(op == "&"))
            return (t[op](p1, p2), c3)
            
        d = corr(E)
        return dfs(0, len(E) - 1)[1]
