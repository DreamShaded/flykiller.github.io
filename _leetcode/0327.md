#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/

#### Solution 1
There is very short solutoin using BST. Let us first evaluate all cumulative sums `S0, S1, ... S_{n-1}`. Then the algorithm is to add sums one by one to BST (SortedList) and for each new element, before we add it, do binary search in our `SortedList` of two borders.

#### Complexity
Overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.


#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class Solution:
    def countRangeSum(self, nums, lower, upper):
        SList, ans = SortedList([0]), 0

        for s in accumulate(nums):
            ans += SList.bisect_right(s - lower) - SList.bisect_left(s - upper)
            SList.add(s)
        return ans
```

#### Solution 2
Here is solution using BIT, see problem 493 for more details. The idea is to create BIT with `n + 1` elements, for example for cumulative sums `[2, 4, 4, 3, 6, 1]` when we add element by element we will have find the **rank** of element, so elements in our BIT will look like: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0] -> [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0] -> [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0] -> [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1] -> [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1]` (it is not real elements, but what list this BIT represents). Then to find how many good elements we have, we need to evaluate sum in range: we need to find range using binary search, for example for number `5` we need to find where in our BIT we should end: it is just after element `4` in our cumulative sums.

#### Complexity
It is also `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
from bisect import bisect, bisect_left

class BIT:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.sums = [0] * (n+1)
    
    def update(self, i, delta):
        while i < len(self.sums):
            self.sums[i] += delta
            i += i & (-i)
    
    def query(self, i):
        res = 0
        while i > 0:
            res += self.sums[i]
            i -= i & (-i)
        return res

class Solution:
    def countRangeSum(self, nums, lower, upper):
        n = len(nums)
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
        bit = BIT(n + 1)
        acc_sorted = sorted(acc)
        
        res = 0
        for s in acc:
            left = bit.query(bisect_left(acc_sorted, s - upper))
            right = bit.query(bisect(acc_sorted, s - lower))
            res += right - left
            bit.update(bisect(acc_sorted, s), 1)
        return res
```

#### Remark
There is Divide and Conquer approach with `O(n log^2n)` complexity: we divide numbers into two parts, solve problem for left and right sub-problems. Now we need to solve it in the middle: range in the middle will be sum of two ranges. We can evaluate all possible values for left and right range in `O(n)`, sort them in `O(n log n)` and then evaluate number of combined ranges in `O(n log n)` also. Recurrent equation is `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n log n)` which gives us `O(n log^2n)` complexity.
