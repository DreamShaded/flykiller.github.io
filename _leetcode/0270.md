title: Leetcode 0270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value
tags: [tree, bst]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/

#### Solution
If target is more that root, check root and right subtree. If target is less or equal than root, check root and left subtree. 
In my notation `dfs(node)` will return pair of values: minimum distance between `target` and elements of subtree with root equal to `node`.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of our BST.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def closestValue(self, root, target):
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return (float("inf"), -1)
            cand = dfs(node.left) if target < node.val else dfs(node.right)
            return min(cand, (abs(node.val - target), node.val))
            
        return dfs(root)[1]
```
