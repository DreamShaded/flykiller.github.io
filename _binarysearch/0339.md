#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Robinhood/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Robinhood/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked.

#### Complexity
It is `O(t)`, where `t` is number of steps. It can be estimated as `log(t/n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, e, o, t):
        p = [e, o]
        steps = 1
        while n < t:
            n *= (1 + p[0]/100)
            p = p[::-1]
            steps += 1
        return steps - 1
        
```
