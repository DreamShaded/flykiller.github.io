#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-of-cutting-a-pizza/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-of-cutting-a-pizza/

#### Solution
Not very difficult from the point of view of idea, but it is easy to mix up with some border cases.
The idea is to use dp with states `dp(k, r, c)`, where `k is number of cuts we still have, `r` and `c` are the size of the rest part. Notice that the part we have always will have right bottom corner fixed. Then if we need to have:
1. Precalculated cumulative sums to evaluate values in each part in `O(1)`. Here `Sum[r][c]` is sum in number of apples in `[0:r+1][0:c+1]` part.
2. When we cut we need to make sure than we have number of apples positive in both parts.
3. If we have zero apples, we need to check `k = 0` case more carefully.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mnk(m+n))` for time and `O(mnk)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def ways(self, pizza, K):
        m, n, MOD = len(pizza), len(pizza[0]), 10**9 + 7
        Sum = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        for r in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
            for c in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                Sum[r][c] = Sum[r][c+1] + Sum[r+1][c] - Sum[r+1][c+1] + (pizza[r][c]=='A')

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(k, r, c):
            if k == 0: return int(Sum[r][c] > 0)
            ans = 0
            
            for nr in range(r + 1, m):  # cut horizontally
                if Sum[r][c] > Sum[nr][c] > 0:
                    ans += dp(k - 1, nr, c)
                            
            for nc in range(c + 1, n):  # cut vertically
                if Sum[r][c] > Sum[r][nc] > 0:
                    ans += dp(k - 1, r, nc)
            return ans % MOD

        return dp(K - 1, 0, 0)
```
