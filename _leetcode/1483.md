#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-ancestor-of-a-tree-node/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-ancestor-of-a-tree-node/

#### Solution
Let us `dp[i][j]` be `2^j` parent of node `i`. Then we can do recursion `dp[i][j] = dp[dp[i][j-1]][j-1]`, that is, `i`-th node's `2^j` parent is `i`-th node's `2^{j-1}` parent's `2^{j-1}` parent. 

#### Complexity
For `init`: it is `O(n log n)` time and space
For `getKthAncestor` time complexity `O(log n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class TreeAncestor:
    def __init__(self, n, parent):
        m = int(log2(n))
        self.dp = [parent] + [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for j in range(m):
            for i in range(n):
                if self.dp[j][i] != -1: 
                    self.dp[j+1][i] = self.dp[j][self.dp[j][i]]
    
    def getKthAncestor(self, node, k):
        while k > 0 and node != -1: 
            i = int(log2(k))
            node = self.dp[i][node]
            k -= (1 << i)
        return node 
```
