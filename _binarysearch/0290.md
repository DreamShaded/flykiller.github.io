#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Big-Numbers/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Big-Numbers/

#### Solution
Let us create `m x n` matrix ans with zeroes. Then we iterate `M` by rows and for each biggest element in row increase element by one. The same logic is for columns. In the end calculate number of `2`s.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, M):
        m, n = len(M), len(M[0])
        ans = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
        for i, row in enumerate(M):
            t = max(row)
            for j, x in enumerate(row):
                if x == t: ans[i][j] += 1

        for i, col in enumerate(zip(*M)):
            t = max(col)
            for j, x in enumerate(col):
                if x == t: ans[j][i] += 1

        return list(chain(*ans)).count(2)
```
