tags: [accumulate]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/List-Min-Replacement/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/List-Min-Replacement/

#### Solution
We need to keep cumulative min of prefixes.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, x):
        x[0], mn = 0, x[0]
        for i in range(1, len(x)):
            x[i], mn = mn, min(x[i], mn)
        return x
```
