#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/

#### Solution
I am not sure, why this problem is marked as medium: all you need to do is to do bruteforce: just consider all numbers before `sqrt(c)` and check if corresponding `b` is integer. Why we need to check all numbers only before `sqrt(c)`? Because square is always not-negative and if first part is greater than `c`, we can not make sum equal to `c`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(sqrt(c))`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c):
        for i in range(int(math.sqrt(c))+1):
            j = c - i*i
            if int(math.sqrt(j))**2 == j: return True
        return False
```
