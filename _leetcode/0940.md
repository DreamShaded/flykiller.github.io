#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences-ii/

#### Solution 1
First idea I have when I see this problem is to use similar idea as problem **0730** Count Different Palindromic Subsequences, here `dfs(i)` is answer for string `S[i:]` and we find first occurrence of letter `a, b, ... z` in this string. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)`, where `m` is size of alphabet, space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def distinctSubseqII(self, S):
        alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        n, MOD = len(S), 10**9 + 7
        
        def letter_get(s, letter, dr):
            res, cur = [-1]*len(s), -1
            for i in range(len(s))[::dr]:
                if s[i] == letter: cur = i
                res[i] = cur
            return res
        
        corrs = defaultdict(list)
        for letter in alphabet:
            corrs[letter] = letter_get(S, letter, -1)
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i):
            if i > n - 1: return 1
            ans = 1
            for letter in alphabet:
                i0 = corrs[letter][i]
                if i <= i0 <= n - 1:
                    ans += dfs(i0 + 1)
            return ans % MOD
                    
        return dfs(0) - 1
```

#### Solution 2
Define by `dp[i]` is number of unique subsequences, which ends with symbol `i`. On each step we will keep `[0]*26` array, because size of alphabet is `26` (in fact originally it is `2d` dp table, but we always need only last line). 

Imagine, that we have `s1, ..., sk` being unique subsequences when we reached symbol with index `j`. What happens when we go to index `j + 1`? Imagine we have new symbol `x`. Then we can say that number of unique subsequences which end with `X` is `k + 1`: `s1 + X, s2 + X, ..., xk + X, X`. Number of unique subsequences which ends on the other symbols stays the same.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time, where `m` is size of alphabet and `O(m)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        dp = [0] * 26
        mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
        for ch in s:
            dp[ord(ch) - ord("a")] = (sum(dp) + 1) % mod
        return sum(dp) % mod
```
#### Solution 3
There is very elegant and short solution with `O(n)` complexity as well! Let us add symbol by symbol and evaluate how many options we have. We need to multiply it by two and subtract all subsequences we meet twice: for this we need to find previous occurrence of letter we are adding. Imagine we have `acbab`, we found all subsequences for `acba`:

1. `"", a, b, c, ac, ab, aa, cb, ca, ba, acb, aca, aba, cba, acba`
2. New ones are `b, ab, bb, cb, acb, abb, aab, cbb, cab, bab, acbb, acab, abab, cbab, acbab`
3. Repetitions are `b, ab, cb, acb`, number of it equal to `dp[2]`

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def distinctSubseqII(self, S):
        dp, last = [1], {}
        for i, x in enumerate(S):
            dp.append(dp[-1] * 2)
            if x in last:
                dp[-1] -= dp[last[x]]
            last[x] = i

        return (dp[-1] - 1) % (10**9 + 7)
```

#### Remark
See similar problem **1987**. Number of Unique Good Subsequences
