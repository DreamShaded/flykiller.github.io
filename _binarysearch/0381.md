#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-Set-of-Pairs/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-Set-of-Pairs/

#### Solution
The idea that if we have nubmers `a <= b <= c <= d`, then it is always optimal to choose as one pair numbers `a, d` and for another pairs numbers `b, c`. Then we iterate through pairs `(a, d)` and then for each of them iterate through inner range `[i + 1, j - 1]`, where we look for the number closest to `nums[i] + nums[j]`, using to pointers technique.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^3)` for time and `O(1)` for additional space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        nums = sorted(nums)
        n, ans = len(nums), float("inf")
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i, n):
                curr = nums[i] + nums[j]
                beg, end = i + 1, j - 1
                while beg < end:
                    pair = nums[beg] + nums[end]
                    ans = min(ans, abs(pair - curr))
                    if pair < curr:
                        beg += 1
                    else:
                        end -= 1
        return ans
```
