title: Leetcode 1103. Distribute Candies to People

There are different ways how you can handle this problem, I prefer mathematical way. Let us define `k = num_people` and `n = candies` and try to understand how many candies we need to give to `i`-the person.  

| 1    | 2   | 3    | ... | k   |
|------|-----|------|-----|-----|
| **k+1**  | **k+2** | **k+3**  | **...** | **2k**  |
| **...**  | **...** | **...**  | **...** | **...** |
| **sk+1** | **...** | **sk+i** |     |     |

We need to find the biggest `s`, such that the sum of numbers before is less or equal to `n`. Let us compute it:

**1.** First row: `k(k+1)/2`, sum of arithmetic progression.

**2.** Second row: `k(k+1)/2 + k^2`.

**3.** Third row:  `k(k+1)/2 + 2*k^2`.
...

**s-1.** `k(k+1)/2 + (s-1)*k^2`.

**s.** `s*k*i + i(i+1)/2`.

Let us evaluate this sum and solve quadratic inequality:

So, we have root `s = ((-1-2*i) + sqrt(1+8*n))/(2*k)` and we need to find the biggest integer number which is less than `s`, let us define it `t = floor(s)`.
Now, how many candies we need to give to this person? It is `i + (k+i) + ... + (sk+i) = i*(t+1) + k*t*(t+1)//2`. Finally, we need to find the last person, who gets the rest of the candies. How we can do it? I evaluate difference `s - floor(s)` and choose the person with the biggest difference.

**Complexity**: time and space complexity is `O(k)`, where `k` is number of people. 


```
class Solution:
    def distributeCandies(self, candies, num_people):
        k, n = num_people, candies
        alloc = [0]*k
        Final = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, k+1):
            s = ((-1-2*i) + sqrt(1+8*n))/(2*k)
            t = floor(s)
            alloc[i-1] = i*(t+1) + k*t*(t+1)//2
            Final = max(Final, (s-floor(s), i)) 
            
        alloc[Final[1]-1] += (n - sum(alloc))
            
        return alloc
