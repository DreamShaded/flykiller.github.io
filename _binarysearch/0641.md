#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Candy-Race-with-Different-Types/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Candy-Race-with-Different-Types/

#### Solution
Variation of Leetcode 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String - in fact we just need to check how many steps we can make: it can be proved that it is always the same.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        stack, ans = [], 0
        for symb in s:
            if stack and stack[-1] == symb:
                stack.pop()
                ans += 1
            else:
                stack.append(symb)
        return ans % 2 == 1
```
