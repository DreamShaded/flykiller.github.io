title: Leetcode 0003. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0003/

This is classical problem for sliding window. Let us keep window with elements `[beg: end)`, where first element is included and last one is not. For example `[0, 0)` is empty window, and `[2, 4)` is window with `2` elements: `2` and `3`.
Let us discuss our algorithm now:
1. `window` is set of symbols in our window, we use set to check in `O(1)` if new symbol inside it or not.
2. `beg = end = 0` in the beginning, so we start with empty window, also `ans = 0` and `n = len(s)`.
3. Now, we continue, until one of two of our pointers reaches the end. First, we try to extend our window to the right: check `s[end] in window` and if we can, add it to set, move `end` pointer to the right and update `ans`. If we can not add new symbol to set, it means it is already in `window` set, and we need to move left pointer and move `beg` pointer to the right.

**Complexity**: we move both of our pointers only to the left, so time complexity is `O(n)`. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        window = set()
        beg, end, ans, n = 0, 0, 0, len(s)
        
        while beg < n and end < n:
            if s[end] not in window:
                if end + 1 < n: window.add(s[end])
                end += 1
                ans = max(ans, end - beg)
            else:
                window.remove(s[beg])
                beg += 1
                
        return ans
```
