#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Leaderboard/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Leaderboard/

#### Solution
Put all values to set and sort it, then create correspondences `d` and iterate through array.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        d = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(sorted(set(nums))[::-1])}
        return [d[x] for x in nums]
```
