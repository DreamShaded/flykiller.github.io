#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimal-Submatrices/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimal-Submatrices/

#### Solution
The idea is to use Leetcode problem 239. Sliding Window Maximum first for one dimention and then for another.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, matrix, k):
        def maxS(nums):
            deq, n, ans = deque([0]), len(nums), []

            for i in range (n):
                if deq[0] <= i - k:
                    deq.popleft()
                while deq and nums[i] <= nums[deq[-1]] :
                    deq.pop()
                deq.append(i)
                ans.append(nums[deq[0]])
                
            return ans[k-1:]

        t = [maxS(row) for row in matrix]
        t2 = [maxS(row) for row in zip(*t)]
        return [x for x in zip(*t2)]
```
