tags: [math, bit manipulation]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-gap/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-gap/

#### Solution
Keep index of last found `1`. Iterate through lesser to larger bits and if we meet non-zero bit, update answer and index of last seen bit. 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(32)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def binaryGap(self, n):
        last, ans = -1, 0
        for i in range(32):
            if n & (1<<i):
                if last != -1: ans = max(ans, i - last)
                last = i
        return ans
```
