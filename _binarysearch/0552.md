#### Problem statement

#### Solution 1
Define by `dp[i]` is number of subsequenes ending at `A[i]` which have `k` terms. Then we can increase `k` bo one if we use classical `O(n^2)` dp: the number of ways with `k + 1` terms which end with `A[j]` can be calculated as sum over all `dp[i]`, where `i < j`, and `A[i] < A[j]`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2 k)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A, k):
        MOD, n = 10 ** 9 + 7, len(A)
        dp = [1] * n
        for k in range(k - 1):
            dp2 = [0] * n
            for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                for i in range(j):
                    if A[i] < A[j]:
                        dp2[j] += dp[i]
            dp = [x % MOD for x in dp2]

        return sum(dp) % MOD
```


#### Solution 2
There is a better solution. The trick is to keep `k` binary indexed trees. We add element by element, starting from the smallest values and in `dp[j][t]` we keep number of Increasing subsequences of length `j`, which ends with `A[t]` element. When we add each next greater element, we can use our binary indexed trees to quickly find all smaller elements, instead of `O(n)`, we can do it in `O(log n)` time.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n k)` for time and `O(n*k)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class BIT:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.sums = [0] * (n+1)

    def update(self, i, delta):
        while i < len(self.sums):
            self.sums[i] = (self.sums[i] + delta) % (10**9 + 7)
            i += i & (-i)
    
    def query(self, i):
        res = 0
        while i > 0:
            res = (res + self.sums[i]) % (10**9 + 7)
            i -= i & (-i)
        return res

class Solution:
    def solve(self, A, k):
        n = len(A)
        dp = [BIT(n) for i in range(k)]
        arr = sorted([(x, i) for i, x in enumerate(A)])
        d = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(sorted(A))}

        for i in range(n):
            idx = d[A[i]]
            for j in range(k - 1):
                dp[j].update(idx + 1, dp[j + 1].query(idx))
            dp[k - 1].update(idx + 1, 1)

        return dp[0].query(n)
```
