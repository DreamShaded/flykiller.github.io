#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Set-Bits/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Set-Bits/

#### Solution
We can use recursion here: if we have say `n = 100100`, then we can look at `10010` and calculate answer from it. Here we need to count number of one bits in prefix as well and I do it with bit count, which is `O(log n)`. If needed we can make it in `O(log n)` for all prefixes, but it is fast enough like this.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log^2n)` for time and `O(log n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        if n == 1: return 1
        return self.solve(n//2) * 2 + (n+1)//2 - ((n+1)%2) * bin(n).count("1")
```
