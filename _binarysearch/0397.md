#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Fractional-Knapsack/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Fractional-Knapsack/

#### Solution
The idea is to sort by `value/weight` and start with the biggest ones.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, weights, values, capacity):
        items = list(zip(weights, values))
        items.sort(key = lambda x: -x[1] / x[0])

        ans = 0
        for w, v in items:
            taken = min(capacity, w)
            capacity -= taken
            ans += taken * v / w
        return int(ans)
```
