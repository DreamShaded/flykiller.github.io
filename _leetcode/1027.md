tags: [dp, counter]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence/

#### Solution
Let `best[i, d]` means the longest arithmetic subsequence, which ends with element `A[i]` and have difference `d`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestArithSeqLength(self, A):
        best = Counter()
        for i in range(len(A)):
            for j in range(i):
                d = A[i] - A[j]
                best[(i,d)] = max(best[(i,d)], 1+best[(j,d)])
        return max(best.values()) + 1
```
