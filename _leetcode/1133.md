title: Leetcode 1133. Largest Unique Number
tags: [counter, array, oneliner]
---

What we need to do is to apply counter and then find maximum element with frequency `1`.

We can write it in the form of oneliner: find maximum and if it is empty, we return `-1`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, we need to traverse our number just once. Space complexity is `O(n)` as well, because counter can have this size.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def largestUniqueNumber(self, A):
        return max([num for num, freq in Counter(A).items() if freq == 1] or [-1])
```
