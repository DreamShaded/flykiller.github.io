title: Leetcode 0811 Subdomain Visit Count

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/subdomain-visit-count/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/subdomain-visit-count/

#### Solution
For each count-paired domain, first split it by space, then iterate over it, and if we meet `.`, add element to counter. Also add full url to counter as well.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is total length of all `cpdomains`, because it is given, that we can have only `1` or `2` dots in address. Space complexity is also `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def subdomainVisits(self, cpdomains):
        cnt = Counter()
        for cpdomain in cpdomains:
            count, url = cpdomain.split()
            cnt[url] += int(count)
            for i in range(len(url)):
                if url[i] == ".": cnt[url[i+1:]] += int(count)
                    
        return [str(t) + " " + c for c, t in cnt.items()]
```
