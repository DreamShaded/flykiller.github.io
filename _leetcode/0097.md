tags: [dp, string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/

#### Solution
In `dp(i, j)` we keep `1` if it is possible to form string `s3` upto `i+j` symbol from first `i` elements of `s1` and first `j` elements of `s2`. Every moment we need to check two at most two neighbors: `dp(i, j - 1)` and `dp(i - 1, j)`: we need to check if symbol `s[i+j+1]` is equal to `s2[j]` and answer is true for `dp(i, j-1)` and `j >= 0`, or similar condition for another string.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)`, because we have `mn` states and two transactions from one state to others. Space complexity is `O(mn)` as well, which can be reduced to `O(m + n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isInterleave(self, s1, s2, s3):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == -1 and j == -1: return True
            return (j >= 0 and s2[j] == s3[i+j+1] and dp(i, j-1)) or (i >= 0 and s1[i] == s3[i+j+1] and dp(i-1,j))
        
        return len(s1) + len(s2) == len(s3) and dp(len(s1) - 1, len(s2) - 1)
```
