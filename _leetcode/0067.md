title: Leetcode 0067. Add Binary

---
What we need to do in this problem is just add two numbers given in binary representation. How we can do it? 
Using usual schoolbook columnar addition of course! 


So, we need to start from the last column and add two digits and also not to forget about `carry`. 
We need to stop when we reached beginning of both numbers. `d1` and `d2` are current processed digits. 
We form `summ` string, adding element to the end and in the end we reverse it.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are lengths of numbers, space complexity is `O(max(m,n))`, because result will have this length.

```

class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a, b):
        i, j, summ, carry = len(a) - 1, len(b) - 1, "", 0
        while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
            d1 = int(a[i]) if i >= 0 else 0
            d2 = int(b[j]) if j >= 0 else 0
            summ += str((d1 + d2 + carry) % 2)
            carry = (d1 + d2 + carry) // 2
            i, j = i-1, j-1 
        return summ[::-1]
```
