#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/toss-strange-coins/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/toss-strange-coins/

#### Solution
Let `dp(i, j)` be probability to have `j` heads if we already used coin upto number `i` inclusive. Then we have border cases:
1. If `j < 0`: we can not have negative number of head or `i - j < -1`, that is we have more coins that we can get heads.
2. If `i == -1`, we return 1, it means we do not have coins and number of heads we need is `0`.
3. Finally to evaluate `dp(i, j)` we need to look at `dp(i-1, j)` and `dp(i-1, j-1)`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n*k)` for time and space. Notice, that we need to be careful with lru_cache, sometimes it will give TLE, if we put `None` as parameter, we can try to use `10000` for example and it will pass.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def probabilityOfHeads(self, P, target):
        @lru_cache(None)
        
        def dp(i, j):
            if j < 0 or i - j < -1: return 0
            if i == -1: return 1
            return dp(i-1, j)*(1-P[i]) + dp(i-1, j-1)*P[i]
        
        return dp(len(P) - 1, target)
```
