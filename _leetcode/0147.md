title: Leetcode 0147. Insertion Sort List
tags: []
---

In this problem we are asked to implement insertion sort on singly-linked list data structure. And we do not really have a choice how to do it: we just need to apply definition of Insertion Sort. Imagine, that we already sorted some part of data, and we have something like:
`1 2 3 7` **4** `6`,
where by bold **4** I denoted element we need to insert on current step. How we can do it? We need to iterate over our list and find the place, where it should be inserted. Classical way to do it is to use **two pointers**: `prv` and `nxt`, stands for previous and next and stop, when value of `nxt` is greater than value of node we want ot insert. Then we insert this element into correct place, doing `curr.next = next, prv.next = curr`. Also, now we need to update our `curr` element: for that reason in the beginning of the loop we defined `curr_next = curr.next`, so we can update it now.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n^2)`, as Insertion sort should be: we take `O(n)` loops with `O(n)` loop inside. Space complexity is `O(1)`, because what we do is only change connections between our nodes, and do not create new data.

```python
class Solution:
    def insertionSortList(self, head):
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        curr = head
        while curr:
            curr_next = curr.next
            prv, nxt = dummy, dummy.next
            while nxt:
                if nxt.val > curr.val: break
                prv = nxt
                nxt = nxt.next
                
            curr.next = nxt
            prv.next = curr
            curr = curr_next
        
        return dummy.next
```
