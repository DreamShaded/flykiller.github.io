#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Stacks/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Stacks/

#### Solution
Just keep cumulative sums for each list and then find the biggest element in intersection.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m)` for time and `O(k)` for space, where `m` is total number of elements in all lists and `k` is the length of the longest list.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, S):
        if not S: return 0
        A = set([0] + list(accumulate(S[0])))
        for i in range(1, len(S)):
            A &= set([0] + list(accumulate(S[i])))
        return max(A)
```
