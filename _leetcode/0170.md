#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-iii-data-structure-design/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-iii-data-structure-design/

#### Solution
We can just keep our number in `Counter`. When we get new number just increase frequency. When we asked to find, iterate over `num` in our counter and if it is equal to half of `value`, check that frequency is at least `2`. If it is not equal, check if we have corresponind number.

#### Complexity
Time complexity for `add` is $O(1)$, for `find` is $O(n)$. Space complexity of total data structure is $O(n)$`.

#### Code
```python
class TwoSum:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cnt = Counter()
        
    def add(self, number: int) -> None:
        self.cnt[number] += 1
        
    def find(self, value: int) -> bool:
        for num in self.cnt:
            if num*2 == value:
                if self.cnt[num] >= 2: return True
            else:
                if value - num in self.cnt: return True
           
        return False
```

#### Remark
We can see that we have trade-off here between complexities of two operations. There is another solutions, where each time when we add new numbers, we add all pairs, so `add` will be $O(n)$ and `find` will be $O(1)$, total space complexity is $O(n^2)$. I am wondering if there is solution with say $O(\sqrt{n})$ complexity for both operations?
