How we can check that number is power of `4`? Straightforward algorithm is to try to divide it by `4` and check if we have `1` after several divisions, but complexity of this approach will be `O(log n)`. There is smarter way. To check that number is power of `4`, we need to check `3` conditions:

1. Number is positive.
2. Number is power of `2`.
3. This power of `2` is even power.

First condition is trivial. For the second condition we can use `x&(x-1)` trick, which removes the last significant bit of binary representation, for example `11010 & 11001 = 11000`. Number is power of two if it have only one significant bit, that is after this operation it must be equal to zero.

The last part is a bit tricky. Hopefully if reached this step, we already know, that number is a power of `2`, so we have not a lot of options left: `1`, `10`, `100`, `1000`, ... How we can distinguish one half of them (odd powers) from another half? The trick is to use binary mask `m = 1010101010101010101010101010101`. For even powers of `2` we have for example `m&100 = 100`, if we use odd power, for example `m&1000 = 0`.

**Complexity**: both time and space is `O(1)`, and this is honest `O(1)`, not `O(32)` or `O(16)`.

        return num > 0 and num & (num-1) == 0 and 0b1010101010101010101010101010101 & num == num
