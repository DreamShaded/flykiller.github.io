#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Knight-Moves-to-Target-Coordinate/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Knight-Moves-to-Target-Coordinate/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1197 Minimum Knight Moves, but here to get AC we need a bit more efficient algorithm. We can use `dp`. If `(r, c) == (0, 0)` then answer is `0`. If we have `(2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2)` then we have `2` steps. In other cases, we can make step in direction `1, 2` or `2, 1`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(rc)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, r, c):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(x, y):
            if x + y == 0: return 0
            if x + y == 2: return 2
            return min(dp(abs(x - 1), abs(y - 2)), dp(abs(x - 2), abs(y - 1))) + 1
        return dp(r, c)
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(1)` math solution using greedy strategy and a lot of edge cases.
