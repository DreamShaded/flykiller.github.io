<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Consecutive-Run-of-1s-in-Binary/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Consecutive-Run-of-1s-in-Binary/

#### Solution
Transfrom to string, then use split or groupby.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        s, ans = bin(n)[2:], 0
        for i, j in groupby(s):
            if i == "1": ans = max(ans, len(list(j)))
        return ans
```
