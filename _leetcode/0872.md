title: Leetcode 0872 Leaf-Similar Trees
tags: [tree, dfs, bfs]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/

#### Solution
Just traverse both trees with dfs or bfs and compare final lists.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n1 + n2)`, where `n1` and `n2` are number of nodes in our trees.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1, root2):
        nodes = [[], []]
        def dfs(node, ind):
            if not node: return
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                nodes[ind].append(node.val)
            dfs(node.left, ind)
            dfs(node.right, ind)
        
        dfs(root1, 0)
        dfs(root2, 1)
        return nodes[0] == nodes[1]
```
