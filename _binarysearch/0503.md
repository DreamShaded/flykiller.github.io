#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Maximum-Sum-Removing-K-Numbers-From-Ends/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Maximum-Sum-Removing-K-Numbers-From-Ends/

#### Solution
What we need to find is minimum sum in window of size `n - k`, than answer is sum of all numbers minus this sum. It can be done for example with use of prefix sums.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
        w = len(nums) - k
        ans = min(acc[i + w] - acc[i] for i in range(k + 1))
        return sum(nums) - ans
```
