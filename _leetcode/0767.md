tags: [string, counter]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/

#### Solution
Use counter to calculate frequency of each letter. If letter has frequency more than half of all elements, return empty string. Then let us sort letter by frequency and start to fill it: first using even indexes, then using odd indexes: for this I use `d` dictionary.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n + A log A)`, where `A` is size of dictionary, space is `O(n + A)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, S):
        cnt, n = Counter(S), len(S)
        if max(cnt.values()) > (n + 1)//2: return ""
        Q = "".join(i*j for i,j in sorted(cnt.items(), key = lambda x: -x[1]))
        d = {i:j for i,j in zip(list(range(0,n,2)) + list(range(1,n,2)), range(n))}
        return "".join(Q[d[i]] for i in range(n))
```

#### Remark
Another way is to use priority heaps. Note, that this problem is special case of problem **0358** Rearrange String k Distance Apart, here `k = 1`
