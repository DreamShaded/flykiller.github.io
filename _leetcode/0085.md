#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/

#### Solution
There is dp `O(n^2m^2)` solution. We can do better, with `O(nm*min(m,n))` complexity, if we use dynamic programming and keep two tables: `h[i][j]` is the largest `L`, such that all elements in `A[i:i+L-1][j] = 1`, and similar `w[i][j]`. Then we go through our original table `A` and we can calculate for `A[i][j]` the largest subarray that has `A[i][j]` as its bottom-left corner, it can be done with `O(n)` iterations.

Finally, there is very smart way with complexity `O(nm)`, using problem **0084**. Indeed, for each row we can evaluate our skyline heights, given previous row in `O(m)` and do it `n` times. Additional complexity is `O(m)`, because actually we need to keep only one row at at time.

#### Complexity
It is `O(nm)` for time and `O(m)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix):
        def hist(heights):
            stack, ans = [], 0
            for i, h in enumerate(heights + [0]):
                while stack and heights[stack[-1]] >= h:
                    H = heights[stack.pop()]
                    W = i if not stack else i-stack[-1]-1
                    ans = max(ans, H*W)
                stack.append(i)
            return ans
        
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]: return 0
        m, n, ans = len(matrix[0]), len(matrix), 0
        row = [0]*m
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                row[j] = 0 if matrix[i][j] == "0" else row[j] + 1
            ans = max(ans, hist(row))
            
        return ans
```
