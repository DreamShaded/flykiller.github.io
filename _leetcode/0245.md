title: Leetcode 0245. Shortest Word Distance III
tags: [string, two pointers, array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-iii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-iii/

#### Solution
If words are not equal, use problem **0243**. If they are equal, it is again two pointers, but when see new occurrence of the word, we update the smallest index

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$ and space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestWordDistance(self, wordsDict, word1, word2):
        p1, p2 = -float("inf"), float("inf")
        ans = float("inf")
        
        if word1 != word2:
            for i, word in enumerate(wordsDict):
                if word == word1:
                    p1 = i
                    ans = min(ans, abs(p2 - p1))
                if word == word2:
                    p2 = i
                    ans = min(ans, abs(p2 - p1))
        else:
            for i, word in enumerate(wordsDict):
                if word == word1:
                    p1, p2 = p2, i
                    ans = min(ans, abs(p2 - p1))
                    
        return ans
```
