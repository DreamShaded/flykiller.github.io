#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Unique-Fractions/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Unique-Fractions/

#### Solution
Use gcd to put number into its canonical form, then sort.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, F):
        s = set([(x/y, x//gcd(x, y), y//gcd(x, y)) for x, y in F])
        return [(x, y) for _, x, y in sorted(s)]
```
