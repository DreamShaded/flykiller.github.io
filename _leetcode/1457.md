title: Leetcode 1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1457/
---

First note, that pseudo-palindromic path mean that it has all occurunces of digits even, may be except one: like 11223 can be written as 12321 and 111444 can not, because it has two digits with odd occurences. So, for each leaf we need to evaluate occurences of all digits and count it only if number of odd occurences is <=1.

Let ```dict_freq``` be a frequences dictionary for digits, where we keep 0 if we meet digit even number of times and 1 if we meet digit odd number of times. Let ```Pal``` be a variable, which counts number of odd frequences in ```dict_freq```: we want to find all leafs, for which this value is <= 1.

Now, what we do is simple dfs: preorder traversal. Because ```dict_freq``` is global variable and we change it in our recursion, we need to change back it values, when we go outside of recursion (note, that in some other solutions, which use bit manipulations, it is not necessary,  but here we need to do like this). Finally, because we do only O(1) operations for each node, we have O(n) time complexity. We have O(k+H) space complexity, where H is the height of tree and k is number of digits (here k = 9) to maintain implicit stack and ```dict_freq``` dictionary.


```python
class Solution:
    def dfs(self, root):
        if not root: return
        
        cur, pal = self.dict_freq[root.val], self.Pal
        
        self.Pal = self.Pal - 1 if cur == 1 else self.Pal + 1
        self.dict_freq[root.val] = (cur + 1) % 2
        
        if not root.left and not root.right and self.Pal <= 1:
            self.Res += 1
        
        self.dfs(root.left)
        self.dfs(root.right)
            
        self.Pal, self.dict_freq[root.val] = pal, cur
            
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root):
        self.dict_freq = defaultdict(int)
        self.Pal, self.Res = 0, 0
        self.dfs(root)
        return self.Res
```
