#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-blacklist/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-blacklist/

#### Solution 1
Here we use similar idea as in problem **0519**: Random Flip Matrix: imagine, we have set `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and we delete `0` and `3` from it. Then we want to make correspondence between `[0, 1, 2, 3]` and `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, we can create connections: `{3: 5, 0: 4}`: the size of this dictionary will be `O(B)`, where `B` is size of blacklist. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity of preprocessing is `O(B log B)`, space is `O(B)`. Time complexity of sample is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, N: int, blacklist: List[int]):
        self.N, self.dic = N, {}
        for num in sorted(blacklist, reverse = True):
            self.dic[num] = self.dic.get(self.N-1, self.N-1)
            self.N -= 1
        
    def pick(self):
        rand = random.randint(0, self.N-1)
        return self.dic.get(rand, rand)
```

#### Solution 2
We can do similar algorithm in `O(B)` preprocessing time, if we do not sort blacklist and deal only with numbers, which are small than `N-B`: we try to add element to dictionary if it is not occupied yet and if it is, we decrease `N` by one.

#### Complexity
Time complexity for init is `O(B)`, space is `O(B)`. Time complexity of sample is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, N, blacklist):
        B, set_bl = len(blacklist), set(blacklist)
        self.M, self.dic = N - B, {}
        for num in blacklist:
            if num < self.M:
                while N-1 in set_bl: N-=1
                self.dic[num] = N-1
                N -= 1     

    def pick(self):
        rand = random.randint(0, self.M - 1)
        return self.dic.get(rand, rand)
```
