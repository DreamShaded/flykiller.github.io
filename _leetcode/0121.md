title: Leetcode 0121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0121/
---

Classical dynamic programming problem. Let `dp[i]` be a maximum profit we can have if we sell stock at `i`-th moment of time. Then we can get, that `dp[i+1] = max(dp[i] + q, q)`, where `q = nums[i+1] - nums[i]`, we have two choices, either we just buy and immeditely sell and get `q` gain, or we use `dp[i] + q` to merge two transactions. 

Note now, that we do not really need to keep all `dp` array, but we can keep only last state.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, nums):
        ans, dp = 0, 0
        for i in range(0, len(nums)-1):
            q = nums[i+1] - nums[i]
            dp = max(dp + q, q)
            ans = max(ans, dp)
        return ans
```
