#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/

#### Solution
One way to solve this problem is tries, but I think it can be a bit overkill for medium difficulty quesion, so I prefer some other idea. 

We can sort all our words and use two pointers idea. Then we add letter by letter from our word `W` (originally it was `searchWord`, I renamed it for more consice code) and adjust our searching range `[beg, end]`. If `len(P[beg])` is less or equal to `i`, it means that word we have in current index of `P` is too short, so we need to more `beg` to the right. Also if we have `P[beg][i] != c`, it means that current index is not good either, so we need to move it to the right as well. Similar logic is done for `end` pointer.

In the end of each iteration we have the property, that words in range `[beg, end]` have the same `i` starting letter with `W`. So, we try to choose `3` words or less if it is not possible (it can be `0` words as well, if `[beg, end]` is empty.

#### Complexity
Let, `m = len(W)`, `n = len(P)`, `L` is the biggest lenght of words in `P`. Then for sort we need `O(L * n * log n)` time. Then we need `O(n)` time for two pointers approach: we make `m` steps to move our pointers, which one with `O(1)` complexity. Also on each of `m` steps for `i` we add at most `3` words to final answer and spend `O(m*L)` total time for it. So, final time complexity is `O(L * n * log n + m * L)`. Space complexity is `O(n*L)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, P, W):
        P.sort()
        beg, end, ans = 0, len(P) - 1, []

        for i, c in enumerate(W):
            while beg <= end and (len(P[beg]) <= i or P[beg][i] != c):
                beg += 1
                
            while beg <= end and (len(P[end]) <= i or P[end][i] != c):
                end -= 1
                
            ans.append(P[beg:min(end+1, beg+3)])

        return ans
