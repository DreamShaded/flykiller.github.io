title: Leetcode 0226. Invert Binary Tree
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0226/
---

Here what we need to do is just use definition of **inverted** tree. We go from top to bottom of our tree and if we reached the leaf, we do not do anything. If current subtree is not a leaf, we recursively call our function for both its children, first inverting them.

**Complexity** is `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of our tree.

```python
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root):
        if not root: return None
        root.left, root.right = self.invertTree(root.right), self.invertTree(root.left)

        return root
```
