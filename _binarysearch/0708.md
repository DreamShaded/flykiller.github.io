#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Largest-Sum-After-K-Negations/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Largest-Sum-After-K-Negations/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A, k):
        A = sorted(A)
        
        i = 0
        while i < len(A) and i < k and A[i] < 0:
            A[i] = -A[i]
            i += 1
        return sum(A or [0]) - (k - i) % 2 * min(A or [0]) * 2
```
