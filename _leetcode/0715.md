#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/range-module/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/range-module/

#### Solution
Let us try to keep set of non-overlapping intervals in sorted order. For example, we have `[0, 2], [4, 6], [8, 10], [12, 14]` and we want to insert `[5, 11]`. What will happen after we try to add this interval: it will be `[0, 2], [4, 11], [12, 14]`. Perfect data structure to deal this updates is Sorted List in python: we need to look for the place of left end and for the place of right place. Also we need to check if we need to include numbers `left` and `right`: for this we can check parity of start and end. It works in similar way for `removeRange` as well. For `queryRange`, we just need to check that start is equal to end and that they are odd numbers.

#### Complexity
Imagine, that we make `A` add ranges, `R` remove and `Q` query ranges. Then we have complexity `O((A + R + Q) * log(A + R))` Why? Because on each step number of ranges can be increased by at most `1`, so we have no more than `A + R` of them, so each binary search we need at most `O(log(A + R))` operations. Also at each iteration number of segments can either increased by 1, 0 or decreased. Sometimes it can be decreased a lot, like `O(A + R)`, but we can say that `decreament = increment + O(A + R)`, increment is `O(A + R)`, so decrements is also `O(A + R)`. So in the end we will do `O(A + R)` add and deletions from our sorted list, complexity of each of them is `O(log(A + R))`.

#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class RangeModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ranges = SortedList()
        
    def rangeHelper(self, left, right, bit):
        start = SortedList.bisect_left(self.ranges, left)
        end = SortedList.bisect_right(self.ranges, right)
        for _ in range(end - start): self.ranges.pop(start)

        if start % 2 == bit: self.ranges.add(left)
        if end % 2 == bit: self.ranges.add(right)

    def addRange(self, left, right):
        self.rangeHelper(left, right, 0)

    def removeRange(self, left, right):
        self.rangeHelper(left, right, 1)
		
    def queryRange(self, left, right):
        start = SortedList.bisect_right(self.ranges, left)
        end = SortedList.bisect_left(self.ranges, right)
		
        return start == end and start % 2 == 1
```

#### Remark
See also similar Problem **0057** Insert Interval, which is subproblem of this one: `addRange` function. There is also Segment Tree solution, TBD.
