#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-three-parts-with-equal-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-three-parts-with-equal-sum/

#### Solution
First we need to check that sum is divisible by `3`. Then we need to look at prefixes and suffixes and check if we have values `sm//3` among them. Finally, if we have, check that the first place in prefix is smaller than the last place of suffix minus one.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def canThreePartsEqualSum(self, arr):
        sm = sum(arr)
        if sm % 3 != 0: return False
        pref = list(accumulate(arr))
        if sm//3 not in pref: return False
        suff = list(accumulate(arr[::-1]))
        if sm//3 not in suff: return False
        idx1, idx2 = pref.index(sm//3), len(arr) - 1 - suff.index(sm//3)
        return idx1 + 1 < idx2
```
