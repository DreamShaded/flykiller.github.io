title: BinarySearch 0093 A Strictly Increasing Linked List
tags: [linked list]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/A-Strictly-Increasing-Linked-List/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/A-Strictly-Increasing-Linked-List/

#### Solution
Just traverse our linked list and if we have next element less or equal than current, return False. Return True in the end if we reached it.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, head):
        while head.next:
            if head.next.val <= head.val:
                return False
            head = head.next
        return True        
```
