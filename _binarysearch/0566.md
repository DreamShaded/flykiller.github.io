#### Problem statement

#### Solution
Quite difficult problem, I thought to solve it with bruteforce, where we add no more than `3` digits to each number, but in python (and possibly in other languages) it will give TLE. Let us use `dp(i, j, k, carry)`, where it is the answer how many digits we need to add to make equation  `A[:i+1] + B[:j+1] + carry == C[:k+1]` possible.

The problem is what to do with extra zeroes, imagine the case `3 + 4862 = 26`, then we need to go to the negative index `-2` to make it `403 + 4862 = 5265`.

1. If `i <= -1 and j <= -1` means that digits in `A` and `B` are finished, so we need to add digits to number `C`. If balance is `0` or `-1` (it can not be smaller): in fact there can be cases: 
    1. When `prefix3 = 0, carry = 0`, then add nothing, in fact it will be covered `i <= -1`, `j <= -1` and `k <= -1`.
    2. When `prefix3 = 1, carry = 1`, then add nothing.
    3. When `prefix3 = 0, carry = 1`, then in fact `k <= -1`, so it will be covered later.
    4. Also if we have `i == -1` or `j == -1`, than one number is finished, another is not.

2. If `k <= -1`, then it means that number `C` is finished, so we just need to add digits to either `A` or `B`.

3. If we already have equalty for given place, than we add it to options.
4. Also we can try to add digit to number `A`: here we need to deal with case of extra zeroes.
5. Similar logic for number `B`.
6. Final case is to add digit to number `C`.


#### Complexity
It is `O(n^3)`, where `n` is maximum length of `A, B, C`.
