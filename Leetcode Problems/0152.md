title: Leetcode 0152. Maximum Product Subarray
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0152/

Let `dp1[i]` be the maximum product which ends with `i`-th index and `dp2[i]` be the minimum product which ends with `i`-the index. Why we need both maximum and minimum? Because we can have big negative number, which then multiplied by negative will give big positive number.

So, let us traverse all numbers and update our `dp1` and `dp2`:
1. If `nums[k] > 0`, then biggest number `dp1[k]` can be found as maximum of `dp1[k-1] * nums[k]` and `nums[k]`. The smallest number `dp2[k]` is equal to minimum of `dp2[k-1] * nums[k] and nums[k]`
2. If `nums[k] <= 0`, then the biggest number is maximum of `dp2[k-1] * nums[k]` and `nums[k]`  and the smalles number `dp2[k]` is minimum of  `dp1[k-1] * nums[k]` and `nums[k]`
3. Finally, we return maximum of `dp1`.

**Complexity**: both time and space is `O(n)`. Space complexity can be improved to `O(1)`, because we always use only previous elements in our `dp1` and `dp2` tables.

```
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums):
        N = len(nums)
        dp1 = [0] * N
        dp2 = [0] * N
        dp1[0] = dp2[0] = nums[0]
        
        for k in range(1, N):
            if nums[k] > 0:
                dp1[k] = max(dp1[k-1] * nums[k], nums[k])
                dp2[k] = min(dp2[k-1] * nums[k], nums[k])
            else:
                dp1[k] = max(dp2[k-1] * nums[k], nums[k])
                dp2[k] = min(dp1[k-1] * nums[k], nums[k])
        
        return max(dp1)
