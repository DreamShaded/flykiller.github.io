#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Tree-Sum-Path-From-Root-to-Leaf/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Tree-Sum-Path-From-Root-to-Leaf/

#### Solution
The idea is to use `dfs(node, val, dep)`, where `node` is current node we are in, `val` is sum of values from `node` to root and `dep` is the depth of `node`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(h)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, root):
        def dfs(node, val, dep):
            if not node:
                self.ans = max(self.ans, (dep, val))
                return
            dfs(node.left, val + node.val, dep + 1)
            dfs(node.right, val + node.val, dep + 1)

        self.ans = (0, 0)
        dfs(root, 0, 0)
        return self.ans[1]
```
