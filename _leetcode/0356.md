#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/line-reflection/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/line-reflection/

#### Solution
Find point with smallest and biggest $x$ coordinate in $O(n)$, it this way we evaluate one possible candidate for our reflection line $x = x_0$. Put all point into set, and for every point $(x, y)$ in set check if point $(2\cdot x_0-x, y)$ also in set.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is $O(n)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isReflected(self, points):
        mid2 = (min(points)[0] + max(points)[0])
        cnt = {tuple(p) for p in points}
        for x, y in cnt:
            if (mid2 - x, y) not in cnt:
                return False
            
        return True
```
