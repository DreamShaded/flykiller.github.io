title: Leetcode 0434 Number of Segments in a String
tags: [string, two pointers]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-segments-in-a-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-segments-in-a-string/

#### Solution
That is what exactly function `.split()` will do, we just need to find number of parts. 

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countSegments(self, s):
        return len(s.split())
```

#### Remark
If `split()` is not allowed, we can use two pointers approach with `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space or we can use only one pointer and find number of places `i`, for which which `s[i-1]` is space or `i = 0` and `s[i]` is not space.
