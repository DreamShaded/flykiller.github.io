#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/???/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/???/

#### Solution
The idea is to try to put the smallest digit to the first place: we need to know where the closest `0` is, closest `1` and so on. For each digit we keep deque of places where this digit is. Also we keep sorted list of visited indexes. On each step we try `0, 1, 2, .., 9` and evaluate step: how many swaps we need to do to get this digits on its place. Actually it equal to `index - seen.bisect(index)`, see cases `9999901` and `9999910` to get more details.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n * log n)`.

#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class Solution:
    def minInteger(self, num, k):
        places, n = defaultdict(deque), len(num)
        for i, d in enumerate(num):
            places[d].append(i)
        ans, seen = "", SortedList()

        while k > 0 and len(seen) != n:
            for d in digits:
                if places[d]:
                    index = places[d][0]
                    steps = index - seen.bisect(index)
                    if steps <= k:
                        k, ans = k - steps, ans + d
                        places[d].popleft()
                        seen.add(index)
                        break
        
        return ans + "".join(s for i,s in enumerate(num) if i not in seen)
```
