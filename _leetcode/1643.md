Actualy, I was suprised, why this problem is marked as Hard: all you need to do is to on each moment of time see how many options we have if we go to the right and if we can afford this step or no. If we are out of options, that is `k = 1`, then we build the rest of the sequence either with `H` or with `V`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O((m+n)^2)` for time: we use `comb()` function `O(m+n)` times, where complexity of each evaluation is `O(m+n)` as well. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallestPath(self, destination, k):
        m, n, ans = destination[0], destination[1], ""
        for i in range(m+n):
            if k == 1:  #no options left
                ans += "H"*n + "V"*m
                break

            if k <= comb(m+n-1, m):
                n -= 1
                ans += "H"
            else:
                ans += "V"
                k -= comb(m+n-1, m)
                m -= 1
                
        return ans
```
