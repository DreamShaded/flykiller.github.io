#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/output-contest-matches/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/output-contest-matches/

#### Solution
We can generate the order of numbers first and then put brackets in right places. For example, we can generate `[1,8,4,5,2,7,3,6]` first and pattern `(((#,#),(#,#)),((#,#),(#,#)))` and then put our numbers into pattern. How we can generate numbers? Look at `[1,4,2,3]`, then we need to put after each number `k`, number `9-k`, similar for next steps. 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity will be `O(n)`, because we do `O(1) + O(2) + O(4) + ... + O(n/2) + O(n)` operations. Space complexity is `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findContestMatch(self, n):
        matches = [1, 2]
        pattern = "(#,#)"
        for step in range(2,int(log2(n))+1):
            pattern = pattern.replace("#", "(#,#)")
            matches = list(chain(*[[i, (1<<step)-i + 1] for i in matches]))
            
        res, it = "", 0
        for symb in pattern:
            if symb != "#":
                res += symb
            else:
                res += str(matches[it])
                it += 1
        
        return res
```
