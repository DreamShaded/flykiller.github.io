<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/

#### Solution
Go through array, and keep the last index for each number in hash table. Check if it was long time ago or not.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums, k):
        d = defaultdict(list)
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            d[num].append(i)
        
        for s in d.values():
            if any(b-a <= k for a,b in zip(s, s[1:])): return True
            
        return False
```
