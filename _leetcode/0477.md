tags: [math, bit manipulation]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/total-hamming-distance/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/total-hamming-distance/

#### Solution
Go bit by bit and let `m_i` be number of zeros for `i`-th bit and `n_i` be number of ones for `i`-th bit. Then we need to add `m_i * n_i` to total hamming distance.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(32n)`, where `n` is number of numbers, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def totalHammingDistance(self, nums):
        n, ans = len(nums), 0
        for i in range(32):
            s = sum(num >> i & 1 for num in nums)
            ans += s*(n-s)
        return ans
```
