#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/ways-to-split-array-into-three-subarrays/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/ways-to-split-array-into-three-subarrays/

#### Solution
The idea is to fix left array and then use binary search to find number of options. We have two restrictions:

1. `left < mid`, it can be written as `acc[start] >= 2*acc[i]`, where we need to start from index `i+1`.
2. `mid < end`, it can be written as `acc[end] <= (acc[i] + acc[-1])/2`, where we need to deal with last element case.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def waysToSplit(self, nums):
        acc = list(accumulate(nums))
        ans = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(acc):
            start = bisect.bisect_left(acc, 2*x, i+1)
            end = bisect.bisect(acc, (x + acc[-1])/2)
            if end == len(nums): end -= 1
            if start < end:
                ans += (end - start)

        return ans % (10**9 + 7)
```
