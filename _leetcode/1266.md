#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-visiting-all-points/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-visiting-all-points/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked: for two adjacent points we need to spend `max(W, H)` time, where `W` and `H `are vertical and horizontal distances.

#### Complexity
 Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, P):
        return sum(max(abs(x2-x1), abs(y2-y1)) for (x1, y1), (x2, y2) in zip(P, P[1:]))
```
