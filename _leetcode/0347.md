There are solution, using quickselect with `O(n)` complexity in average, but I think they are overcomplicated: actually, there is `O(n)` solution, using **bucket sort**. The idea, is that frequency of any element can not be more than `n`. So, the plan is the following:

1. Create list of empty lists for bucktes: for frequencies `1`, `2`, ..., `n`.
2. Use `Counter` to count frequencies of elements in `nums`
3. Iterate over our Counter and add elements to corresponding buckets.
4. `buckets` is list of lists now, create one big list out of it.
5. Finally, take the `k` last elements from this list, these elements will be top K frequent elements.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, because we first iterate over `nums` once and create buckets, then we flatten list of lists with total number of elements `O(n)` and finally we return last `k` elements. Space complexity is also `O(n)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums, k):
        bucket = [[] for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]
        Count = Counter(nums).items()  
        for num, freq in Count: bucket[freq].append(num) 
        flat_list = list(chain(*bucket))
        return flat_list[::-1][:k]
```
