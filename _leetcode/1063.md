tags: [monotonic deque, stack]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-subarrays/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-subarrays/

#### Solution
What is actually asked in this problem: for every index $i$ we need to find the smallest $j > i$, such that `nums[j] < nums[i]`.
Let us traverse our numbers and put them into stack (in fact we will put indexes), such that we always have **non-decreasing** order in our stack.
For example if we have `[1, 4, 2, 3, 5]`, then we have the following steps.

`[1]`
`[1, 4]`
`[1, 2]`
`[1, 2, 5]`
`[1, 2, 3]`

Note, that when we extract some element from stack, e.g we have `[1, 4]` and next element is `2`, it means that we found answer for number `4`, so we add it to final answer.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is $O(n)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def validSubarrays(self, nums):
        nums += [float('-inf')]
        res, stack, n = 0, [], len(nums)
        
        for i in range(n):
            while stack and nums[stack[-1]] > nums[i]:
                res += i - stack.pop()
            stack.append(i)
        return res
```
