#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Line-Segment/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Line-Segment/

#### Solution
Just check some geometrical conditions: that all triples of points `0, 1, k` lies on the same line.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, P):
        if len(P) <= 2: return True
        return all((P[0][0] - P[k][0])* (P[1][1] - P[k][1]) == (P[1][0] - P[k][0]) * (P[0][1] - P[k][1]) for k in range(2, len(P)))
```
