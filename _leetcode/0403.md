#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/

#### Solution
Classical DP problem, let `dp(place, step)` be equal to `True`, if it is possible to reach `place` such that last step was made is `step`. We need to look to `3` positions: `dp(place - step, step)`, `dp(place - step, step + 1)`, `dp(place - step, step - 1)`. We can use `lru_cache` in python, which is quite useful. Or we can use standard `n x n` table.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` both for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def canCross(self, stones):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(pl, st):
            if pl not in stones_set: return False
            if pl == 0 and st == 0: return True     
            if st <= 0: return False     
            return dp(pl - st, st) or dp(pl - st, st+1) or dp(pl - st, st-1)

        stones_set = set(stones)
        return any(dp(stones[-1], k) for k in range(1, len(stones)))
```
