tags: [hash table, union find, intervals]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/data-stream-as-disjoint-intervals/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/data-stream-as-disjoint-intervals/

#### Solution
We can keep two hash table for intervals `[x1,y1], ... [xk, yk]` as `{x1:y1, ..., xk:yk}` and `{y1:x1, ... , yk:xk}` as well as visited numbers. Then we can add new number `v` in `O(1)`: we look for `v - 1` and `v + 1` in our tables. We need to consider `4` different cases:

1. When we have `[x...v-1] [v+1 ... y]`, then we need to merge two intervals to one.
2. When we have `[x...v-1]`, then we need to extend this interval.
3. When we have `[v+1...y]`, then we need to extend this interval.
4. When we have `[]`, then we need to create new interval `[v]`.

To implement `getIntervals`, we need to sort intervals and return the answer.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(1)` for `addNum` and `O(k log k) <=  O(n log n)` for `getIntervals`. Space complexity is potentiallly `O(n)`. 

#### Code
```python
class SummaryRanges:
    def __init__(self):
        self.d1, self.d2, self.all = {}, {}, set()

    def addNum(self, v):
        if v in self.all: return
        self.all.add(v)
        i1 = self.d2.get(v - 1, -1)
        i2 = self.d1.get(v + 1, -1)
        lft, rgh = v - 1 in self.d2, v + 1 in self.d1
                
        if lft and rgh:
            self.d1[i1] = i2
            self.d2[i2] = i1
        elif lft and not rgh:
            self.d1[i1] = v
            self.d2[v] = i1
        elif not lft and rgh:
            self.d2[i2] = v
            self.d1[v] = i2
        else:
            self.d1[v] = v
            self.d2[v] = v
            
        self.d2.pop(v - 1, None)
        self.d1.pop(v + 1, None)

    def getIntervals(self):
        return sorted([[i, self.d1[i]] for i in self.d1])
        
```
