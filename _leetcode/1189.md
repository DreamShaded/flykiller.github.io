#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-balloons/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-balloons/

#### Solution
All you need to do in this problem is to count number of each symbols, specifically `a`, `b`, `l`, `n`, `o`. Then we need to find letter with minimum frequency, but also taking into account that we need two `l` and two `o`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(26)` to keep counter.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfBalloons(self, text):
        cnt = Counter(text)
        return min(cnt["b"], cnt["a"], cnt["l"]//2, cnt["o"]//2, cnt["n"])
```
