#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/

#### Solution
Straightforward solution is just to check for each string all prefixes with $O(\sum\limits_i^n w_i^2)$ solution, where `w1, w2, ... wn` are lengths of our words. We can do better if we sort our words before by length and then iterate from shortest to longest.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n\log n \overline{w} + \sum\limits_i^n w_i)$. We need to use key `(-len(s), s)`, because in the end we want to return the longest word with smallest lexicographical order.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestWord(self, words):
        d = defaultdict(int)
        words_set = set(words)
        words.sort(key = lambda s: (-len(s), s))
        for word in words[::-1]:
            if len(word) > 1 and word[:-1] in words_set:
                d[word] = d[word[:-1]] + 1
            elif len(word) == 1:
                d[word] = 1
            else:
                d[word] = 0
                
        for word in words:
            if d[word] == len(word): return word
```

#### Remark
Actually we can remove $O(n\log n\overline{w})$ time if we use Tries to sort our words. Alternatively we can put all words in Trie and then traverse it, using dfs.

I saw very similar hard problem with different constraints, but I do not remember its number.
