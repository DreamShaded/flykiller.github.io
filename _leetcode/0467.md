title: Leetcode 0467 Unique Substrings in Wraparound String
tags: [string, dp]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-substrings-in-wraparound-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-substrings-in-wraparound-string/

#### Solution
Let `dp[i]` be the maximum length of substring which end with letter number `i`. For example `dp[3] = 5` means, that maximum length of substring ending with letter `c` is equal to `5`, that is there exists substring `yzabc`, but not exists substring `xyzabc`. Then we traverse our string and if next symbol is equal to previous plus `1` (or `z -> a`), then we increase variable `max_len`: which denotes the maximum length of increasing substring, ending in given place. Also we update our `dp` table while we iterate. Also I use stop symbol in the end of string.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(26)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findSubstringInWraproundString(self, p):
        dp, p, max_len = [0] * 26, p + "#", 1

        for i in range(1, len(p)):
            place = ord(p[i-1])%26
            dp[place] = max(max_len, dp[place])
            if (ord(p[i]) - ord(p[i-1])) % 26 == 1:
                max_len += 1
            else:       
                max_len = 1
                
        return sum(dp)
```
