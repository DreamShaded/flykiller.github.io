tags: [sort, accumulate]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Set-Split/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Set-Split/

#### Solution
Given constraints that every number in one set must be smaller than any in another, we do not have a lot of options to split data: we need to sort it and then we have no more than `n` options. We nedd to check that `sum(nums)//2` in our accumulate sums as well as it is on the place we allowed to split, for example if we have `[9, 9]`, we can not take it.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        nums = sorted(nums)
        acc = list(accumulate(nums))
        if acc[-1] % 2 == 1: return False
        if acc[-1]//2 not in acc: return False
        idx = acc.index(acc[-1]//2)
        if nums[idx] == nums[idx + 1]: return False
        return True
```
