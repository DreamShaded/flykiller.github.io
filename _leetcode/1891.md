title: Leetcode 1891 Cutting Ribbons
tags: [binary search, array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/cutting-ribbons/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/cutting-ribbons/

#### Solution
The idea is to use binary search: as question: can we get `k` ribbons of length `mid`. I think I saw exaclty the same problem on leetcode in different formulation.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxLength(self, R, k):
        beg, end = 0, max(R) + 1
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if sum(i//mid for i in R) >= k:
                beg = mid
            else:
                end = mid
        
        return beg
```
