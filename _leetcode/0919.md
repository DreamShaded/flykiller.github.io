#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/complete-binary-tree-inserter/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/complete-binary-tree-inserter/

#### Solution
The idea is to keep so-called **hot** nodes in queue: it is those nodes, to which we need to attach new node. First, to initialize we need to traverse our tree with bfs and put all hot nodes to queue: such that have `0` or `1` children. Then to `insert` we always look at the first hot node and try to attach to it: first to the left and if it is not possible to the right. If we attached to the right, this node stop being hot, so we remove it from queue. Also we add `node` to the end of our queue.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of `init` is `O(m)`, where `m` is number of nodes in tree, space complexity as well. Time complexity of `insert` is `O(1)`, additional space complexity is also `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class CBTInserter:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.levels = deque()
        queue = deque([root])
        while queue:
            el = queue.popleft()
            if not el.left or not el.right: self.levels.append(el)
            if el.left:  queue.append(el.left)
            if el.right: queue.append(el.right)
        
        self.root = root
        
    def insert(self, v):
        node = TreeNode(v)
        parent = self.levels[0]
        if parent.left:
            parent.right = node
            self.levels.popleft()
        else:
            parent.left = node
        self.levels.append(node)
        return parent.val

    def get_root(self):
        return self.root
```
