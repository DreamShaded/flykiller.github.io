title: BinarySearch 0496 Longest Sign Alternating Subsequence
tags: [greedy, groupby]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Sign-Alternating-Subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Sign-Alternating-Subsequence/

#### Solution
We can just use groupby to find number of alternating groups of signs.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        ans = 0
        for x, y in groupby([x < 0 for x in nums]):
            ans += 1
        return ans
```
