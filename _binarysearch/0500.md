#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Optimal-Decrement/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Optimal-Decrement/

#### Solution
Just use heap to extract biggest element `k` times and put decreased element.

#### Complexity
It is `O(k log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        h = [-x for x in nums]
        heapify(h)
        for _ in range(k):
            el = heappop(h)
            heappush(h, el + 1)
        return -h[0]
```

#### Remark
Or we can use binary search here to check if we can reach maximum value equal to `x`.
