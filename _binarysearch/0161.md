#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Palindromic-Anagram/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Palindromic-Anagram/

#### Solution
All we need to do is to counte elements and we can have only one of them with odd frequency.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(26)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        return sum(i%2 == 1 for i in Counter(s).values()) <= 1
```
