#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/occurrences-after-bigram/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/occurrences-after-bigram/

#### Solution
Split into words, then find for our pattern.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n * k)` for time, where `k = max(len(s1), len(s2))` and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findOcurrences(self, text, s1, s2):
        words, ans = text.split(), []
        for i in range(len(words) - 2):
            if words[i] == s1 and words[i+1] == s2:
                ans += [words[i+2]]
        return ans
```
