#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-email-addresses/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-email-addresses/

#### Solution
We need to carefully traverse our emails, replace all dots and also check `+` case.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m)` for time and space, where `m` is the total length of all emails.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numUniqueEmails(self, emails):
        d = Counter()
        for mail in emails:
            local, domain = mail.split("@")
            local = local.replace(".", "")
            if "+" in local: local = local[:local.index("+")]
            d[local + "@" + domain] += 1
            
        return len(d)
```
