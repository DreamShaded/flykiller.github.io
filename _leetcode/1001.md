#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/grid-illumination/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/grid-illumination/

#### Solution
For each lamp calculate index of vertical line, horizontal line and both diagonal lines. Keep `4` counters to check how many turned on lamps we have on each of `4` types of lines.

First step is to traverse set of lamps, and update counters. Note, that in original `lamps` some lamps can be repeated, so we need to traverse set, not list. Then we traverse `queries` and check if we have lamp on one of the `4` lines, then check cell and `8` neighbors and if we have turned on lamps, we turn them of, and update counters.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(Q + L)`, where `Q` is length of queries and `L` is length of lamps. Space complexity is the same.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def gridIllumination(self, N, lamps, queries):
        set_lamps = {(i, j) for i, j in lamps}
        c = [Counter() for _ in range(4)]
        
        def update(x, y, d):
            c[0][x] += d
            c[1][y] += d
            c[2][x+y] += d
            c[3][x-y] += d
          
        for i, j in set_lamps: update(i, j, 1)
            
        ans = []
            
        for x, y in queries:
            ans.append(c[0][x] >= 1 or c[1][y] >= 1 or c[2][x+y] >= 1 or c[3][x-y] >= 1)
            for dx, dy in product([-1,0,1],[-1,0,1]):
                if (x+dx, y+dy) in set_lamps:
                    update(x+dx, y+dy, -1)
                    set_lamps.remove((x+dx, y+dy))
                
        return [int(i) for i in ans]
```
