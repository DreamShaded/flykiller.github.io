tags: [palindrome, dp, string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-iv/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-iv/

#### Solution 1
Function `helper` here will create all possible palindromes: it will work in `O(n^2)` time with early breaks. Then what we can do is to check all palindromes start with `0`-th element and all palindromes which end with `n-1` the elemen and check if the string in the middle is palindrome as well.

#### Complexity
Time is `O(n^2)`, space as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkPartitioning(self, s):
        d1, d2, n = defaultdict(set), defaultdict(set), len(s)
        
        def helper(i, j):
            while i >= 0 and j < n and s[i] == s[j]:
                d1[i].add(j)
                d2[j].add(i)
                i, j = i - 1, j + 1
        
        for k in range(n):
            helper(k, k)
            helper(k, k + 1)
            
        for i in d1[0]:
            for j in d2[n-1]:
                if j-1 in d1[i+1]: return True
                
        return False
```



#### Solution 2
There is a bit slower but more universal approach: we again generate all palindromes, but then we use function `dp(i, k)`, which will answer the question can string `s[i:]` be separated into `k` palindromes.

#### Complexity
It is also `O(n^2)` for both time and space but works slower

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkPartitioning(self, s):
        d, n = defaultdict(set), len(s)
        
        def helper(i, j):
            while i >= 0 and j < n and s[i] == s[j]:
                d[i].add(j)
                i, j = i - 1, j + 1
        
        for k in range(n):
            helper(k, k)
            helper(k, k + 1)
            
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, k): 
            if k < 0: return False 
            if i == n: return k == 0
            return any(dp(j+1, k-1) for j in d[i])
        
        return dp(0, 3)
```
