title: Leetcode 0589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal
tags: [tree, dfs]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/

#### Solution
In this problem we just need to do what is asked: preordrer traversal. Create `stack`, where we put `root` of out tree. Then on each step we extract last element from stack, add it to `out` and then traverse all children. Note, that we need to traverse children in the reversed order, similar to what we did for binary tree, where we traversed first right and then left.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the total number of nodes in our tree, because for every node we need `O(1)` time.

#### Code
```
class Solution:
    def preorder(self, root):
        if not root: return []
        stack, out = [root], []
        while stack:
            cur = stack.pop()
            out.append(cur.val)
            for child in cur.children[::-1]:
                stack += [child]
        return out
```
