#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-distribute-candies/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-distribute-candies/

#### Solution
This problem is about ealuating stirling numbers of the second kind. 
We have reccurent formula `dp(n, k) = dp(n-1, k)*k + dp(n-1, k-1)`: when we add element with index `n` we can either put it in separate set with `dp(n-1, k-1)` number of ways or we add it to one of the `k` sets with `dp(n-1, k)*k` options. Also we have border cases: `dp(0, 0) = 1` and `dp(0, k) = dp(n, 0) = 0` with `n != 0` and `k != 0`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(nk)`, for some reason it is TLE, so we need to reduce cache.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def waysToDistribute(self, n, k):
        @lru_cache(1000)
        def dp(n, k):
            if n == 0 and k == 0: return 1
            if n <= 0 or k <= 0: return 0
            return (dp(n-1, k)*k + dp(n-1, k-1)) % (10**9 + 7)

        return dp(n, k)
```

#### Remark
There is a way to compute number in `O(k log n)` complexity, using the following formula
$$ S(n, k) =\sum _{j=1}^{k}(-1)^{k-j}{\frac {j^{n-1}}{(j-1)!(k-j)!}}$$
