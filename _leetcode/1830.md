#### Solution
Actually, what is asked in this problem is given string understand what is the lexicographical order of this string. For example we have `abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba`, then order of string `cab` is `4` (we start from zero). However, the main difficulty of this problem is that:
1. We can have `n = 3000`, so we expect to have linear or linearithmic complexity.
2. We have repeating symbols and here we need to use combinatorics.

I tried to sumbit like `5` different `O(n^2)` approaches, but they are not working on python as you can guess, so I was forces to think about something better. Let us look at string **cabbcdba** for simplicity. We need to find how many string there is before this string in lexicographcal order.

1. Strings, start with `a` or `b` should be OK for sure, so what we need to do is to find how many symbols less than `c` we have. Total number of strings is `5 * 7!`, because we have two options for the first place and others we can put whatever we want. Also, we have `b` **3**, `a` **2** times and `c` **2** times.  So, we need to divide total number of options by `2! * 3! * 3!`. Google multinomial coefficients for more details. So, total number of options here is `5 * 7!/2!/2!/3!`.
2. Now look at strings starts with `c`. There is not symbols, less than `a`, so here answer is `0`.
3. Now look at strings starts with `ca`, next symbols should be `a` and we have only one options here. So, total number of options is `1 * 5!/3!`, because we have `b` **3** times among the rest symbols we did not used yet.
4. And so on

To achieve good complexity we will use the fact that our string consist only `26` letters. Also we start our process from the end: in this way it will be possible to keep `cnt` array of frequencies and update it and calculate `sum(cnt[:ind])`: number of elements smaller than given one. Also, we need to work with **10^9 + 7** module, which is hopefully prime, so we can use Fermat little theorem to make fast divisions given this module. To divide number by `q` is the same as multiply it by `q^(N-2) % N`. 


#### Complexity
If we have `n` the length of string `s` and `m` is the size of alphabet, we have complexity $O(nm)$ for `cnt` part. Also we evaluate inverses a lot and potentially we can do it `m` times for each iteration, so final time complexity will be $O(nm\cdot \log M)$. Space complexity is $O(n)$.



#### Code

```
class Solution:
    @lru_cache(None)
    def f(self,i):
        return 1 if i <= 1 else (self.f(i-1)*i) % (10**9+7)

    def makeStringSorted(self, s):
        N, n, out = 10**9 + 7, len(s), 0
        cnt = [0]*26
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            ind = ord(s[i]) - ord("a")
            cnt[ind] += 1
            ans = sum(cnt[:ind]) * self.f(n-i-1)
            for j in range(26):
                ans = ans * pow(self.f(cnt[j]), N-2, N) % N
            out += ans
        return out % N
```

#### Solution 2

Here is solution with the better complexity: $O(mn + n\cdot \log M)$

```
class Solution:
    @lru_cache(None)
    def f(self,i):
        return 1 if i <= 1 else (self.f(i-1)*i) % (10**9+7)
    
    @lru_cache(None)
    def inv(self, i):
        N = 10**9 + 7
        return pow(i, N-2, N)

    def makeStringSorted(self, s):
        N, n, out = 10**9 + 7, len(s), 0
        cnt = [0]*26
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            ind = ord(s[i]) - ord("a")
            cnt[ind] += 1
            ans = sum(cnt[:ind]) * self.f(n-i-1)
            for j in range(26):
                ans = ans * self.inv(self.f(cnt[j])) % N
            out += ans
        return out % N
```

#### Solution 3

There is smart way how to evaluate inverses of numbers in some range $[1, k]$ modulo $N$ in $O(k)$ time, see patterns page. So, complexity can be improved to $O(mn + \log M + n) = O(mn)$. Also here we use idea that on each step we can recalculate `comb_tot` in `O(1)`, not in `O(m)`, however it will not improve final $O$ complexity, because of `sum(cnt[:num])` step, but it makes it faster like 2 times.

```python
class Solution:
    def makeStringSorted(self, s):
        MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
        inverses = [1] * (len(s) + 1)
        for a in range(2, len(s) + 1):
            inverses[a] = MOD - ((MOD // a) * inverses[MOD % a]) % MOD

        ans, tot, comb_tot = 0, 0, 1
        cnt = [0] * 26
        for cur in map(ord, reversed(s)):
            num = cur - 97
            cnt[num] += 1
            tot += 1
            comb_tot = (comb_tot * tot * inverses[cnt[num]]) % MOD
            ans += comb_tot * sum(cnt[:num]) * inverses[tot]
        return ans % MOD
```
