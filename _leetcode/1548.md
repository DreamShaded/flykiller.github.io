title: Leetcode 1548 The Most Similar Path in a Graph
tags: [graph, dp]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/the-most-similar-path-in-a-graph/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/the-most-similar-path-in-a-graph/

#### Solution
Let `dp(ind, node)` be minimum distance if we now at index `ind` from `T` and in node `node` in our graph. Then to evaluate `dp(ind, node)` we need to check all neibours. Also we need to keep connections to previous optimal node, so in the end we can reconstruct solution. Also I add dummy node to graph, so we always finish at the node `n`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(m*n^2)`, where `m` is length of `T`, space complexity is `O(mn)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def mostSimilar(self, n, roads, names, T):
        G, end, ans = defaultdict(list), n, []
        for x, y in roads:
            G[x].append(y)
            G[y].append(x)
        
        for x in range(n):
            G[n].append(x)  #not add opposite edges though

        T, names = T + ["@@@"], names + ["@@@"]

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(ind, node):
            if ind == -1: return (0, -1)
            return min((dp(ind - 1, neib)[0] + int(names[node] != T[ind]), neib) for neib in G[node]) 

        for ind in range(len(T) - 1, -1, -1):
            ans.append(end)
            _, end = dp(ind, end)

        return ans[::-1][:-1]
```
