#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/strobogrammatic-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/strobogrammatic-number/

#### Solution
Create hash table of corresponing digits and then check all pairs between original and reversed number.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(m)$, where $m$ is length of `num`, space complexity is $O(10)$. 

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isStrobogrammatic(self, num):
        d = {"0":"0", "1":"1", "6":"9", "9":"6", "8":"8", "2":"", "3":"", "4":"", "5":"", "7":""}
        return all(i==d[j] for i, j in zip(num, num[::-1])) 
```
