title: Leetcode 0299. Bulls and Cows
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0299/

Easy, but interesting problem, because it can be solved in different ways.

1. Let us first evaluate number of bulls `B`: by definition it is number of places with the same digit in `secret` and `guess`: so let us just traverse our strings and count it.
2. Now, let us evaluate both number of cows and bulls: `B_C`: we need to count each digit in `secret` and in `guess` and choose the smallest of these two numbers.  Evaluate sum for each digit.
3. Finally, number of cows will be `B_C - B`, so we just return return the answer!

**Complexity**: both time and space complexity is `O(1)`. Imagine, that we have not `4` lengths, but `n`, then we have `O(n)` time complexity and `O(10)` space complexity to keep our counters.

```python
class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret, guess):
        B = sum([x==y for x,y in zip(secret, guess)])
		Count_sec = Counter(secret)
        Count_gue = Counter(guess)
        B_C = sum([min(Count_sec[elem], Count_gue[elem]) for elem in Count_sec])
        return str(B) + "A" + str(B_C-B) + "B"
```
