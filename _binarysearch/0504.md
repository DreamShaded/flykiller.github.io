#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Substringify/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Substringify/

#### Solution 1
For each substring of length `m` check how different it form `t`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and `O(m + n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, t):
        n, m = len(s), len(t)
        ans = m
        for i in range(n - m + 1):
            ans = min(ans, sum(x != y for x, y in zip(s[i:], t)))
        return ans
```

#### Solution 2
There is also `O(n log n * 26)` time complexity solution, using NTT. The idea is for every letter calculate places where it is and deal them as polynoms.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n * 26)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code

MOD, ROOT = 998244353, 3
 
def ntt(a, inv=0):
    n = len(a)
    w = [1] * (n >> 1)
    w[1] = pow(ROOT, (MOD - 1)//n * (inv*(MOD-3) + 1), MOD)
