#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/

#### Solution
Just iterate our array from the beginning: if we have zero bit, we move `1` position to the right, if it is equal to one, we move two positions to the right. In the end we check if it is equal to `n-1` or not.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits):
        i, n = 0, len(bits)
        while i < n - 1:
            if bits[i] == 1: i += 2
            else: i += 1
        return i == n - 1
```
