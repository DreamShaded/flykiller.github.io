#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/water-and-jug-problem/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/water-and-jug-problem/

#### Solution
Mathematical problem, if we have `x` and `y`, we can create all numbers less than `max(x, y)` such that they divided by `(x, y)`. To prove this however is a bit tricky.

Other possible idea how to solve it is to try to check all options, using dfs or bfs.

#### Complexity

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def canMeasureWater(self, j1, j2, target):
        return target % gcd(j1, j2) == 0 and j1 + j2 >= target
```
