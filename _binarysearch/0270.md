#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Lego-Towers/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Lego-Towers/

#### Solution
Sort heights and then for each window of size `k` check how much we need to pay.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, H, k):
        H = sorted(H)
        n = len(H)
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(H))
        ans = float("inf")
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            ans = min(ans, k*H[i+k-1] - (acc[i + k] - acc[i]))
        
        return ans
```
