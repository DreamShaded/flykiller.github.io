#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-music-playlists/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-music-playlists/

#### Solution 1
Let $\phi(N, L, K)$ be answer for question: how many string of length $L$ we have, where we use $N$ symbols and distance between equal symbols is no more than $K$ (we can use less than all $N$ symbols. Then we can show, that $\phi(N, L, K) = N\cdot (N-1)\cdot\dots \cdot (N-K+1)\cdot (N-K)^{L-K}$. Next, we can use inclusion-exclusion formula to get answer: it is equal to $$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N-K-1}\phi(N-i, L, K)\cdot C_N^i \cdot (-1)^i.$$

#### Complexity
Time complexity of this solution is `O(LN)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numMusicPlaylists(self, N, L, K):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs_comb(i, j):
            if j == 0 or i == j: return 1
            return (dfs_comb(i-1, j) + dfs_comb(i-1, j-1)) % MOD
        
        def phi(N, L, K):
            ans = 1
            for i in range(N - K + 1, N + 1):
                ans = (ans*i) % MOD
            for i in range(L - K):
                ans = (ans*(N - K)) % MOD
            return ans
        
        return sum(phi(N-i, L, K) * dfs_comb(N, i) * (-1)**(i%2) for i in range(N-K)) % MOD
```

#### Remark
Actually, it can be done in `O(N log L)` complexity if we use fast exponentiation and modular arithmetic.


#### Solution 2
There is alternative dp solution: Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of play-lists of length `i` that have exactly `j` unique songs. We want `dp[L][N]`, and it seems likely we can develop a recurrence for dp.

Consider `dp[i][j]`. Last song, we either played a song for the first time or we didn't. If we did, then we had `dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (N - j + 1)` ways to choose it. If we didn't, then we repeated a previous song in `dp[i-1][j] * max(j-K, 0)` ways (`j` of them, except the last `K` ones played are banned.)

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is also `O(NL)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numMusicPlaylists(self, N, L, K):
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == 0: return j == 0
            ans = dp(i-1, j-1) * (N-j+1)
            ans += dp(i-1, j) * max(j-K, 0)
            return ans % (10**9+7)

        return dp(L, N)
```
