#### Problem statement

#### Solution 1
The idea is to keep heap, where we keep tuple `(sum, i1, ... i_{m-1})`: total sum and indexes of elements from each row. When we extract new element, we add `m` new candidates.

#### Complexity
We can have upto `O(m*k)` element in our heap in the end, because we add `m` elements on each step. Size of each element is `O(n)`, so one extraction will be `O(log(mk)*O(n))` and `O(nk*log(mk))` for all extractions. Also we do a lot of pushes, `m` times bigger, so we have `O(nmk*log(mk))` complexity. There is also time for working with tuples, which iteration it is `O(mn)`, so total factor `O(mnk)` will be smaller. Final time complexity is `O(mnk*log(mk))`. Space complexity is `O(mnk)`. Factor `log(mk)` can be reduced to `log(k)` if we keep size of heap no more than `k`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, mat, k):
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        h = [(sum(r[0] for r in mat),) + (0,)*m]
        visited = set()
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            elem = heappop(h)
            for i in range(m):
                if elem[i + 1] + 1 >= n: continue
                tmp = list(elem)
                tmp[0] += (mat[i][elem[i+1] + 1] - mat[i][elem[i+1]])
                tmp[i + 1] += 1
                new = tuple(tmp)
                if new not in visited: 
                    heappush(h, new)
                    visited.add(new)
        
        return h[0][0]
```

#### Solution 2
See similar problem **0373** Find `K` pairs with smallest sums. Actually we can apply it several times.

#### Complexity
Time complexity will be `O(k*log k*m)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, mat, k):
        def kSmallestPairs(nums1, nums2, k):
            if not nums1 or not nums2: return []
            n1, n2 = len(nums1), len(nums2)
            heap = [(num + nums2[0], i, 0) for i, num in enumerate(nums1)]
            heapify(heap)
            result = []

            for _ in range(min(k, n1*n2)):
                num, ind1, ind2 = heappop(heap)
                result.append(nums1[ind1] + nums2[ind2])
                if ind2 < n2 - 1:
                    heappush(heap, (nums1[ind1] + nums2[ind2+1], ind1, ind2+1))

            return result
        
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        res = mat[0]
        for i in range(1, m):
            res = kSmallestPairs(res, mat[i], k)
        return res[k-1]
```
