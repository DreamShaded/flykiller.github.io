title: Leetcode 1181 Before and After Puzzle
tags: [string, hash table, sort]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/before-and-after-puzzle/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/before-and-after-puzzle/

#### Solution
What we need to do is for each sentence extract first and last word and create hash tables `starts`: which for each word say which phrases start with it and `ends`: similar for end. Then for each starting word we check if we have ending word and add all pairs to our answer.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*k)` to put all phrases in dictionary, where `k` is average length of phrase. Then we need to create answer and potentially we can have `O(n^2)` good candidates each of them can have size `O(k)`. So, overall time complexity is `O(n^2 k)`, space complexity as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def beforeAndAfterPuzzles(self, phrases):
        phrases, ans = [p.split() for p in phrases], []
        starts, ends = defaultdict(list), defaultdict(list)

        for i, p in enumerate(phrases):
            starts[p[0]].append(i)
            ends[p[-1]].append(i)

        for s in starts:
            if s in ends:
                for x, y in product(starts[s], ends[s]):
                    if x == y: continue
                    ans.append(" ".join(phrases[y][:-1] + phrases[x]))

        return sorted(set(ans))
```
