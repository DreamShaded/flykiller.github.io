title: Leetcode 1458. Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences
tags: []
---

Let ```dp[i][j]``` be the maximum dot product for first ```i``` numbers from ```nums1``` and first ```j``` numbers from ```nums2```. Note, that ```dp[0][0] = 0``` is for the case where we take 0 elements from both ```nums1``` and ```nums2``` (that is we use dummy first column and row). Let us forgot for the moment, that product need to be **not empty**, then we can just use ```dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i][j] + nums1[i]*nums2[j], dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j])```, because we can:
1. Either include ```nums1[i]*nums2[j]``` into our dot product and we need to add value of ```dp[i][j]```
2. Or do not inculde ```nums1[i]*nums2[j]```, that is choose the best from ```dp[i][j+1]``` or ```dp[i+1][j]``` problems.

Now, if we do it it can happen that our product is **empty**, and we need to handle this case separatly: it can happen if all numbers in one array are negative and all numbers in another array is positive.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDotProduct(self, nums1, nums2):
        M, N = len(nums1), len(nums2)
		
        if (max(nums1) < 0 and min(nums2) > 0):
            return max(nums1) * min(nums2) 
        if (max(nums2) < 0 and min(nums1) > 0):
            return min(nums1) * max(nums2)         
			
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(N+1)] for _ in range(M+1)]
        for i in range(M):
            for j in range(N):
                dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i][j] + nums1[i]*nums2[j], dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j])
        return dp[-1][-1]
```
