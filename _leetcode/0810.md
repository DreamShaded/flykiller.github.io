#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/chalkboard-xor-game/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/chalkboard-xor-game/

#### Solution
We can notice, that if XOR of all numbers is not equal to `0`, there is always turn we can make. Indeed, imagine that we have numbers `a1, ..., an` and one person removed number `ai`, such that game is not lost yet. Then other person can also make a move: remove some other number `aj`, so game is not lost yet. Why there is another number? Because xor of `a1, ... an` and xor for `a1, ... an`  without `ai` both not equal to `0` and it is not possible if all numbers are equal.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def xorGame(self, nums):
        return reduce(xor, nums) == 0 or len(nums) % 2 == 0
```
