#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-with-xor-in-a-range/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-with-xor-in-a-range/

#### Solution
First idea is to look for number less than `T`, not in range.

Second idea is imagine we have `10110`, then numbers smaller than this can be in one of groups, where we use idea of **digits build**: `?` can be any digit here.

`1010?`

`100??`

`0????`

The idea is to calculate counter of `nums` first and then on each iteration recalculate it, using `count[a] + count[a^1]` for number 
`a >> 1`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity will be `O(min(m, n * log(2m/n))`, where `n` is length of `nums` and `m` is maximum among `nums`. The idea is that on first level we can have no more than `m` elements in counter and on each next iteration it can be no more than `m/2` and so on. From another point of view on first level we have `n` values and on each next `log(m/n)` levels we can have again no more than `n`, until we reach `n` bits, and then no more than `n/2` and so on. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
#### borrowed code
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, nums, low, high):
        def test(x):
            count, res = Counter(nums), 0
            while x:
                if x & 1:
                    res += sum(count[a] * count[(x^1) ^ a] for a in count)
                count = Counter({a >> 1: count[a] + count[a ^ 1] for a in count})
                x >>= 1
            return res // 2
        return test(high + 1) - test(low)
```

#### Remark
Alternative solution is to use Tries: put all numbers in Trie and then for each possible start from digits build, for example `100..`, consider all `2^3` possible starts and check how many elements in our Trie we have such that xor is equal to `100`. Time complexity will be `O(n log m)`
