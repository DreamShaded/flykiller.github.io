tags: [stack, monotonic deque, greedy]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/buildings-with-an-ocean-view/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/buildings-with-an-ocean-view/

#### Solution
The idea is to start from the ocean and add elements to stack only if they bigger than last element in the stack. In the end return reversed stack.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, H):
        n, ans = len(H), []
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if not ans or H[i] > H[ans[-1]]:
                ans += [i]
                
        return ans[::-1]
```
