tags: [dp, math, binary search]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/

#### Solution
Let us try to solve a bit different problem instead: given `T` moves and `K` eggs, denote by `f(T, K)` the highest floor we can solve problem for. Then we need to find the smallest `T`, such that `f(T, K) >= N`. We can write down the following recursion:

`f(T, K) = 1 + f(T-1, K-1) + f(T-1, K)`

if ball is broken, we can cover `f(T-1, K-1)` floors, if it is not, we can cover `f(T-1, K)` floors.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(NK)`, space complexity as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def superEggDrop(self, K, N):
        dp = [[0] * (K+1) for _ in range(N+1)]
 
        for i in range(1, N+1):
            for j in range(1, K+1):
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]
            if dp[i][K] >= N: return i
```

#### Remark
Moreover, it can be shown that $f(T, k) = C_T^1 + \dots + C_T^k$ and using this information, problem can be solved in `O(K log N)`, using binary search.
