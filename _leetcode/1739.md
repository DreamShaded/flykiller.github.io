#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/building-boxes/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/building-boxes/

#### Solution
The idea is that we need to build our boxes in tethahedral numbers. That is first we create pyramid of size `1` with `1` box, then size `2` with `4` boxes, size `3` with `10` boxes, size `4` with `20` boxes and so on. When we do not have boxes for full layer, we need to start to work with triangle numbers: `1, 3, 6, 10, ... `. So we have two steps:

1. Find maximum layer of pyramid: biggest `k`, such that `k*(k+1)*(k+2)//6 <= n`.
2. On the next step we find maximum triangle number `l`, such that `l*(l+1)//2 <= new n`

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^(1/3))` for time and `O(1)` for space. If we have used binary search it whould have been `O(log n)`.


#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumBoxes(self, n):
        for k in range(n+1):
            if k*(k+1)*(k+2) > 6*n: break
                
        n -= (k-1)*k*(k+1)//6
        for l in range(n+1):
            if l*(l+1) >= 2*n: break
                
        return k*(k-1)//2 + l
```
