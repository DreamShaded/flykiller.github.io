#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/

#### Solution
Just keep list of `3` elements and insert in proper place. Like we have `10, 6, 2` and we have `>10` we insert before first element, if we have `>6`, we insert before second element, and we have `>2` we insert before third element. Then we remove last element. Or we can use functionality of `bisect.insort()`, which will insert element in `O(1)`, because size is always no more than `3`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def thirdMax(self, nums):
        cands = []
        for num in nums:
            if num not in cands: insort(cands, num)
            if len(cands) == 4: cands.pop(0)
        
        return cands[0] if len(cands) == 3 else cands[-1]
```
