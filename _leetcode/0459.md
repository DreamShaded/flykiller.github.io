Nice and easy problem, which can be solved in different ways.

### Solution 1

Just check all posible divisors of lenght of `s`, replicate them and compare them with original string. If we have found it, we return `True`, if we reached the end and we did not find any, we return `False`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n*sqrt(n))`, because we have no more than `O(sqrt(n))` divisors of number `n` (we can split them into pairs, where one number in pair will be `<sqrt(n)`. Space compexity is `O(n)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s):
        N = len(s)
        for i in range(1, N//2+1):
            if N % i == 0 and s[:i]* (N//i) == s:
                return True
        return False
```

### Solution 2
But wait, there is more! There is in fact very short and interesting solution. Let us replicate our sting, remove first and last elements and try to find original string: for example:

`s = abcdabcd`, then we have `bcdabcdabcdabc`, where we can find `abcdabcd` inside. It is a bit more difficult to prove, that opposite is true: if we found substring it will mean that we have repeated substring pattern. I will add proof a bit later.

**Complexity**: time complexity is basically `O(n)`, because we can find substrings in linear time. In python function `in` will work, using Boyer-Moore algorithm, which is in average work in linear time (if you do not like average, you can use KMP, which have worst linear time, not average). Space complexity is `O(n)`.

```
return s in (s+s)[1:-1]
```
