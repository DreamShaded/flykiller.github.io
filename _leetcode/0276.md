title: Leetcode 0276. Paint Fence
tags: [dp]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-fence/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-fence/

#### Solution
Problem formulation is not clear: what is meant that there can not be three posts in a row with the same color, not what is stated.
The idea is to have `dp` with two states: `a` means that last two posts painted in the same color and `b` means that they painted in different colors. Then we can update them in `O(1)`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$, space is $O(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, n, k):
        a, b = 0, k
        for i in range(n-1):
            a, b = b, (a + b)*(k - 1)
            
        return a + b
```
