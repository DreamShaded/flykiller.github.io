#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/

#### Solution
We can traverse our trie using bfs, and when the first time we meet `None` in our queue we need to make sure that all elements in our queue are `None`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(w)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root):
        queue = deque([root])

        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if not node: return all(i == None for i in queue)
            queue.append(node.left)
            queue.append(node.right)
            
        return True
```
