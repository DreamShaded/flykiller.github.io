If you use python, this problem becomes not medium, but rather easy: all you need to do is to `split()` you data and take elements in negative order. `split()` is smart enough to ignore several spaces in a row as well as extra spaces in the begin and in the end.

**Complexity**: both time and memory complexity is `O(n)`, because we traverse all string and we create new with size `O(n)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        return " ".join(s.split()[::-1]) 
```

**Futher discussion**:  We can not do better than `O(n)` space in python, because strings are immutable. However if we are given not string, but array of symbols, we can remove all extra spaces, using **Two pointers** approach, reverse full string and then reverse each word. Time complexity will be `O(n)` and space will be `O(1)`.

Here is the python code:
1. We traverse `chars` with two pointers and rewrite symbols in the beginning.
2. Cut our `chars`, removing last elements (in my code it is not really inplace, but you can use `del` to do it in place)
3. Reverse list using `chars.reverse()`.
4. Use two pointers to reverse each word.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s):       
        chars = [t for t in s]
        slow, n = 0, len(s)
        for fast in range(n):
            if chars[fast] != " " or (fast > 0 and chars[fast] == " " and chars[fast-1] != " "):
                chars[slow] = chars[fast]
                slow += 1
                
        if slow == 0: return ""       
        chars = chars[:slow-1] if chars[-1] == " " else chars[:slow]
        chars.reverse()
        
        slow, m = 0, len(chars)
        for fast in range(m + 1):
            if fast == m or chars[fast] == " ":
                chars[slow:fast] = chars[slow:fast][::-1]
                slow = fast + 1
                
        return "".join(chars)
```
