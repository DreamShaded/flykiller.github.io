#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-palindrome/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-palindrome/

#### Solution
Basically, we need to find the longest prefix, which is  palindrome. Create string `s + "!" + s[::-1]`, and then we need to calculate the **prefix** function for this new string, namely, the value for the last element. See also problem **1392**.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestPalindrome(self, s):
        def prefix(s):
            p = [0] * len(s)
            for i in range(1, len(s)):
                k = p[i - 1]
                while k > 0 and s[k] != s[i]:
                    k = p[k - 1]
                if s[k] == s[i]:
                    k += 1
                p[i] = k
            return p
        
        max_index = prefix(s + "!" + s[::-1])[-1]
        return s[:max_index-1:-1] + s
```

#### Remark
Another way to solve this problem in `O(n)` (in average) is to use rolling hash.
