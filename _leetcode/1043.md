title: Leetcode 1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum
tags: [dp, array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-for-maximum-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-for-maximum-sum/

#### Solution
Notice that here `k` is the maximum size of subarray, not number of subarrays!
Let `dp[i]` be the answer for `A[:i+1]`. Then we need to look at previous `k` values and keep running maximum.

#### Complexity
It is `O(nk)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
     def maxSumAfterPartitioning(self, A, K):
        n = len(A)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            curMax = 0
            for k in range(min(K, i)):
                curMax = max(curMax, A[i - k - 1])
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - k - 1] + curMax * (k + 1))
        return dp[-1]
```
