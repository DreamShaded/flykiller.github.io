#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-into-increasing-sequences/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-into-increasing-sequences/

#### Solution
Let `m` be the biggest frequency of number in our array. Notice, that if `m*k > len(nums)`, than we can be sure, that we can not split our array into sequenes. Actually, what is true is the opposite as well: if we have `m*k <= len(nums)`, then we always can split our array. Indeed if we allocate `nums[i]` to group with number `i % m`, then there will be no two equal elements in each group, also it means that each group will have at least `k` elements.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def canDivideIntoSubsequences(self, nums, k):
        return len(nums) >= max(Counter(nums).values()) * k
```
