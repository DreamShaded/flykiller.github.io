title: Leetcode 0398 Random Pick Index
tags: [math, random]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-index/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-index/

#### Solution
For each element create list of indexes which has this elements and then just use random sample to choose one of the elements.

#### Complexity
Time is `O(n)` for init and `O(1)` for `pick`. Space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, nums):
        self.d = defaultdict(list)
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            self.d[num] += [i]
        
    def pick(self, target):
        return random.sample(self.d[target], 1)[0]
```

#### Remark
There is also reservoir sampling technique but it has `O(n)` complexity and not good for this problem.
