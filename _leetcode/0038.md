#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/

#### Solution
Just do what it says, efficient algorithm is to use groupby function from python. 

#### Complexity
Potentially sequence can extend upto `O(2^n)` elements, so we have `O(2^n)` time and space complexity.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n):
        state = "1"
        for _ in range(n-1):
            state = "".join([str(len(list(j))) + str(i) for i, j in groupby(state)])
        return state
```
