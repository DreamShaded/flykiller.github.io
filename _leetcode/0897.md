Let us construct new tree, using already existing nodes. My `dfs` function will have two outputs: node with smallest value (root of tree) and node with biggest value (leaf of tree). Then, all we need to do is to run `dfs` recursively:

1. First, we denote `l1 = node` and `r2 = node`, this is for the case, if we will not have left or right children.
2. If we have left children, we create straight tree for left subtree using recursion and attach our `node` as right children of leaf of this tree.
3. If we have right children, we againg create straigh tree for right subtree using recursion and attach `r1` as right children of `node`.
4. We put left children of node to `None` to avoid loops in our final tree.
5. Return `dfs(root)[0]`: only root of constructed tree, not need to return leaf.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, because we visit each node exactly once. Space compexity is `O(h)`, height of our tree.

```python
class Solution:
    def increasingBST(self, root):
        def dfs(node):
            l1, r2 = node, node
            
            if node.left: 
                l1, l2 = dfs(node.left)
                l2.right = node
                
            if node.right:
                r1, r2 = dfs(node.right)
                node.right = r1
            
            node.left = None
            return (l1, r2)
        
        return dfs(root)[0]
```
