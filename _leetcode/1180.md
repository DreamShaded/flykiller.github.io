title: Leetcode 1180 Count Substrings with Only One Distinct Letter
tags: [math, string, groupby]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-with-only-one-distinct-letter/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-with-only-one-distinct-letter/

#### Solution
What we can do is to apply groupby to calculate lengths of each group of adjacent equal elements. Then for each group we need to calculate `i*(i+1)//2` and sum them all.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity as well. Space complexity can be reduced to `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countLetters(self, s):
        lens = [len(list(j)) for i, j in groupby(s)]
        return sum(i*(i+1)//2 for i in lens)
```
