#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity/

#### Solution
Just use defaultdict: for each word keep set of its similar words. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(N + M)`, where `N` is total length of all words in `pairs` and `M` is total length of all words in `words1 + words2`. Space complexity is `O(N)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def areSentencesSimilar(self, words1, words2, pairs):
        d = defaultdict(set)
        for i, j in pairs:
            d[i].add(j)
            d[j].add(i)
            
        if len(words1) != len(words2): return False
        for w1, w2 in zip(words1, words2):
            if w1 != w2 and w1 not in d[w2]: return False
            
        return True
```
