#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Merging-Two-Sorted-Lists/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Merging-Two-Sorted-Lists/

#### Solution
Just use merge sort with two pointers. Or in python if we use just `sorted(a + b)` it will have linear complexity, because it uses timsort.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m + n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, a, b):
        return sorted(a + b)
```
