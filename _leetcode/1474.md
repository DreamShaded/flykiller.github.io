title: Leetcode 1474 Delete N Nodes After M Nodes of a Linked List
tags: [linked list, two pointers]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-n-nodes-after-m-nodes-of-a-linked-list/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-n-nodes-after-m-nodes-of-a-linked-list/

#### Solution
What we need to do is to traverse our linked list with two poiners: `curr`, which will traverse all linked list and `last` will traverse new list.

1. First, we need to take `m` nodes, so we just iterate and make sure that we did not reach the end. In the end of first stage `last` will point to `m`-th node. 
2. Next we move our `curr` `n` times.
3. Finally, we reconnect `last.next = curr`, exactly for this we needed two pointers, not one.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(k)`, where `k` is total number of nodes, space complexity is `O(1)`, because we used already existing nodes.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def deleteNodes(self, head, m, n):
        curr, last = head, head
        while curr:
            m1, n1 = m, n
            while curr and m1 != 0:
                last = curr
                curr = curr.next
                m1 -= 1
            while curr and n1 != 0:
                curr = curr.next
                n1 -= 1
                
            last.next = curr
            
        return head
```
