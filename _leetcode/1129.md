tags: [graph, bfs]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-with-alternating-colors/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-with-alternating-colors/

#### Solution
We can use bfs here, where state is `(node, color of the last taken edge)`. Then we start with nodes `(0, 1)` and `(0, 0)` and perform bfs.

#### Complexity
It is `O(E)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestAlternatingPaths(self, n, R, B):
        G = defaultdict(list)
        for x, y in R:
            G[x] += [(y, 0)]
        for x, y in B:
            G[x] += [(y, 1)]
            
        queue = deque([(0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0)])
        V = set([(0, 1), (0, 0)])
        ans = [float("inf")] * n
        
        while queue:
            dist, node, last = queue.popleft()
            ans[node] = min(ans[node], dist)
            for neib, col in G[node]:
                if (neib, col) not in V and col != last:
                    V.add((neib, col))
                    queue += [(dist + 1, neib, col)]
        
        return [i if i != float("inf") else -1 for i in ans] 
```
