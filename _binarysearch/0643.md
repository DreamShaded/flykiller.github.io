#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Number-of-K-Length-Sublists-with-Average-at-Least-Target/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Number-of-K-Length-Sublists-with-Average-at-Least-Target/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1343. Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to Threshold.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, arr, k, threshold):
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(arr))
        return sum(acc[i + k] - acc[i] >= threshold * k for i in range(len(arr) - k + 1))
```
