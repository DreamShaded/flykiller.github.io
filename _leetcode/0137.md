title: Leetcode 0137. Single Number II

There are several `'magical'` solutions for this problem I saw in comments, done in `O(n)`, which I really enjoed to read, however I doubt if you never saw this problem you can suceed in real interview. That is why I suggest maybe not the fastest, but much more easier to come up solution. The idea is similar to problem **Single Number**, but here we need to count each bit modulo `3`. So, we
1. Iterate over all possible `32` bits and for each `num` check if this `num` has non-zero bit on position `i` with `num & (1<<i) == (1<<i)` formula.
2. We evaluate this sum modulo `3`. Note, that in the end for each bit we can have either `0` or `1` and never `2`.
3. Next, update our answer `single` with evaluated bit.
4. Finally, we need to deal with overflow cases in python: maximum value for `int32` is `2^31 - 1`, so if we get number more than this value we have negative answer in fact.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(32n)`, which may be not fully honest linear, but is fine for the purpose of this problem. If we want just `O(n)` complexity, I think problem becomes not medium but hard. Space complexity here is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        single = 0
        for i in range(32):
            count = 0
            for num in nums:
                if num & (1<<i) == (1<<i): count += 1
            single |= (count%3) << i
            
        return single if single < (1<<31) else single - (1<<32)   
```
