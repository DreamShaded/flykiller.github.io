#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-matching-subsequences/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-matching-subsequences/

#### Solution
This problem is extension of problem **392 Is Subsequence**, but here we have several patterns we need to find.

Let `n` be length of `s` and `m` be total length of all words in words.  Then we can precompute all places for each symbol in `s` and then use binary search to find if word. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(m*log n + n)`, because we do at most `m` binary searches and we need `O(n)` to evaluate `places`.  Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, S, words):
        def isSubseq(word):
            curr = 0
            for symbol in word:
                ind = bisect_left(places[symbol], curr)
                if ind >= len(places[symbol]):
                    return False
                curr = places[symbol][ind] + 1
            
            return True
        
        places = defaultdict(list)
        for i, symbol in enumerate(S):
            places[symbol].append(i)
        
        return sum(isSubseq(word) for word in words)
