#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-height-by-stacking-cuboids/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-height-by-stacking-cuboids/

#### Solution
My first solution was to sort all cuboids by sum of all dimensions: this is neccesary (but not enough) condition to stack and generate all rotations as well. Then we have `O(6n)` candidates and then we can apply LIS problem with total complexity `O(36n^2)`.

In fact it can be solved in `O(n^2)` complexity: we can always rotate our cuboids such that they have sorted coordinates. 
Imagine, that we have two stacked cuboids `(X1, X2, X3)` and `(Y1, Y2, Y3)`, then it can be shown that `(X_min, X_mid, X_max)` and `(Y_min, Y_mid, Y_max)` also can be stacked, but in this case sum of heights can be only increased. (Easier to show this if we put points on line and check cases).

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxHeight(self, C):
        D = sorted(map(sorted, C))
        
        def check(X, Y):
            return X[0] >= Y[0] and X[1] >= Y[1] and X[2] >= Y[2]
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i == -1: return 0
            return max([dp(j) for j in range(i) if check(D[i], D[j])] or [0]) + D[i][2]
        
        return max(dp(i) for i in range(len(D)))
```
