#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Remove-Interval-Overlaps/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Remove-Interval-Overlaps/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0435. Non-overlapping Intervals.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, intervals):
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[1])
        n, count = len(intervals), 1
        if n == 0: return 0
        curr = intervals[0]
        
        for i in range(n):
            if curr[1] <= intervals[i][0]:
                count += 1
                curr = intervals[i]
                
        return n - count
```
