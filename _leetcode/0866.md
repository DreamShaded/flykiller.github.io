title: Leetcode 0866 Prime Palindrome

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-palindrome/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-palindrome/

#### Solution
Here we need to iterate through palindromes, starting from the smallest one and return the first one, which is bigger than `N`. We need to use `is_prime` function to check if number is prime. Potential time complexity is `O(N)` if we assume that there exists enough palindromes, which works in practice: we check `O(sqrt{N})` numbers with `O(sqrt{N})` complexity to check if it is prime for each of them.

Also we can notice that palindrome of even length will always be divisible by `11`, so there is no need to check them, except number `11` itself.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(N)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def primePalindrome(self, N):
        def is_prime(n):
            return n > 1 and all(n%d for d in range(2, int(n**.5) + 1))

        for L in range(1, 6):
            for half in range(10**(L - 1), 10**L):
                s = str(half)
                x = int(s + s[-2::-1])
                if x >= N and is_prime(x):
                    return min(x, 11) if N <= 11 else x
```
