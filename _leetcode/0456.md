Let us keep evaluate `min_list`, where `min_list[i] = min(nums[0], ..., nums[i])`.
Also let us traverse our `nums` from the end and keep stack with decreasing elements, which are more than `min_list[j]` for given `j`.
We will try to find `132` pattern, where `nums[j]` is middle number in this pattern.

Let us look through the code and see what is going on:
1. If `nums[j] <= min_list[j]`, there is no need to put this number to stack: it means actually that `nums[j]` is less than all previous numbers and it can not be the middle element in our `132` pattern.
2. Now, if `nums[j] > min_list[j]`, we need to keep our stack clean: if we have numbers which are leaa or equal than `min_list[j]`, we remove them from our stack. So, we have now `stack[-1] > min_list[j]`. If it is also happen, that `stack[-1] < nums[j]`, then we are happy: we found our pattern: we choose `stack[-1]` for our `2` in pattern, `nums[j]` for our `3` and element where minumum reached: `min_list[j]` for our `1`:  we have our `1` less than `2` and `2` less than `3`. In this case we immedietly return `True`. In the end we append `nums[j]` to our stack.
3. If we traversed all list and did not found pattern, we return `False`.

So, what exaclty will be in our stack on each step? 
1. There always be numbers more  or equal than  `nums[j]` inside
2. Which are going in decreasing order. 

Why it will not change on the next step? If our next number (`nums[j-1]`) is more than top of our stack, we found our `132` pattern! If it is less, then we put it into our stack and decreasing order is satisfied (property s) and if we have top of our stack equal to `nums[j-1]`, so property `1` is also satisfied.

**Complexty** is `O(n)`, both for time and memory, because we traverse our list twice: once in one direction and once in opposite


```python
class Solution:
    def find132pattern(self, nums):
        min_list = list(accumulate(nums, min))
        stack, n = [], len(nums)
        
        for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if nums[j] > min_list[j]:
                while stack and stack[-1] <= min_list[j]:
                    stack.pop()
                if stack and stack[-1] < nums[j]:
                    return True
                stack.append(nums[j])           
        return False
```
