#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Lossy-Run-Length-Encoding/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Lossy-Run-Length-Encoding/

#### Solution
Let us keep for each prefix and each suffix the following information: `(last symbol, count of it, total length of encoded string)`. Then we can evaluate all these data in `O(n)`. We check if the next symbol is equal to last one and if it is the same, we check if we have edge case, when length goes from `1 -> 2, 9 -> 10, 99 -> 100`, in this case encoding length will increase by one.

After we calculate all this data, we can use it to evaluate what run-length encoding of two parts will be. We need to check if the symbol in the middle is the same and if it is, correct length.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, k):
        n = len(s)
        edges = set([1, 9, 99, 999, 9999, 99999, 999999])

        def f(s):
            arr = [("!", 1, 0)]  #last symb, count of it, total length
            for x in s:
                symb, cnt, ln = arr[-1]
                if x != symb:
                    arr += [(x, 1, ln + 1)]
                else:
                    addon = cnt in edges
                    arr += [(x, cnt + 1, ln + addon)]
            return arr

        lft = f(s)
        rgh = f(s[::-1])[::-1]
        ans = float("inf")

        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            L, R = lft[i], rgh[i + k]
            if L[0] != R[0]:
                ans = min(ans, L[2] + R[2])
            else:
                fix = - len(str(L[1])) - len(str(R[1])) + len(str(L[1] + R[1])) - 1
                if L[1] == 1: fix += 1
                if R[1] == 1: fix += 1
                ans = min(ans, L[2] + R[2] + fix)
        
        return ans
```
