title: Leetcode 0946. Validate Stack Sequences

Let us use iterate through `pushed` and `popped` and on each step we decide what we need to do. Consider example
`pushed = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], popped = [4, 5, 3, 2, 1]`. Let `ind1` and `ind2` be indexes in these lists.

1. `ind1 = 0` and `ind2 = 0`. Stack is empty so far, so all we can do is to push elements, so `stack = [1]` now, increment `ind1`.
2. `ind1 = 1` and `ind2 = 0`. We check if we can pop element from stack right **now**. The reason that we want to pop as soon as possible, that all elements in `popped` (and `pushed`) are different, so if we miss the moment of time when we need to pop, we never do it after. So we check condition `stack and stack[-1] == popped[ind2]` and if it is false, we pop element. It is not the case here, so we push element to stack and increment `ind1`, `stack = [1, 2]`.
3. `ind1 = 2` and `ind2 = 0`, similar logic, increment `ind1` and `stack = [1, 2, 3]`.
4. `ind1 = 3` and `ind2 = 0`, similar logic, increment `ind1` and `stack = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
5. `ind1 = 4` and `ind2 = 0`. Now, we have `popped[ind2] = 4`, which is equal to the top of our stack, so we pop it from stack and increment `ind2`, `stack = [1, 2, 3]`.
6. `ind1 = 4` and `ind2 = 1`. We increment `ind1` and `stack = [1, 2, 3, 5]`.
7. `ind1 = 5` and `ind2 = 1`. Top of stack equal to `popped[ind2]`, so we pop element and increment `ind2`, `stack = [1, 2, 3]`
8. `ind1 = 5` and `ind2 = 2`. Same logic, we increment `ind2` and `stack = [1, 2]`
9. `ind1 = 5` and `ind2 = 3`. Same logic, we increment `ind2` and `stack = [1]`
10.`ind1 = 5` and `ind2 = 4`. Same logic, we increment `ind2` and `stack = []`
11.`ind1 = 5` and `ind2 = 5`, so we do not go inside `while` statement.

Note also, that we need to ckeck condition `ind1 < n`, that is we can push element to stack. If not, then we can immedietly return `False`. In the end, if we reached it we return `True`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`: we traverse each of given list at most once. In the process `stack` and grow up to `O(n)` as well, so space complexity is also `O(n)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def validateStackSequences(self, pushed, popped):
        ind1, ind2, n = 0, 0, len(pushed)
        stack = []
        while ind1 < n or ind2 < n:
            if stack and stack[-1] == popped[ind2]:
                stack.pop()
                ind2 += 1
            elif ind1 < n:
                stack.append(pushed[ind1])
                ind1 += 1
            else:
                return False
        
        return True
