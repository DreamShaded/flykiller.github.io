#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Unique-Occurrences/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Unique-Occurrences/

#### Solution
I think I saw the same on leetcode, but it is quite easy already: just evaluate counter and check that all frequencies are different.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        cnt = Counter(nums).values()
        return len(cnt) == len(set(cnt))
```
