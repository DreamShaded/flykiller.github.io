#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/

#### Solution
There is a simple, but powerful trick, which can help us to solve this problem: we need to start from the end: that is define `dp(x)` be the answer if we gain `x` points. We can say, that `f(x) = f(x+1) + f(x+2) + ... + f(x+W))/W`. Also we can state, that `dp[k] = 1` when `K <= k <= N`, else it is equal to `0`. Finally, we need to go from `K - 1` backwards and evaluate probabilities. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(N + W)`, because we can update average in `O(1)`, space complexity is `O(W)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def new21Game(self, N, K, W):
        dp = [0] * (N + W + 1)
        for k in range(K, N + 1): dp[k] = 1
        
        S = min((N - K + 1)/W, 1)
        
        for k in range(K - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[k] = S
            S += (dp[k] - dp[k + W])/W

        return dp[0]
```

#### Remark
In fact what we have here can be looked as it is Markov Chain.
