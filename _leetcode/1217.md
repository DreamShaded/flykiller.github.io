Quite easy problem when you undrstand what you need to do. So, we have chips on different positions, and we can move them for free in `+2` and `-2` positions: it means, that we can for free move all chips with **odd** positions to one odd position and chips with **even** positions to one even positions. Moreover, we can make these odd and even positions adjacent. So, what we need to do now is just calculate how many we have on even positions and on odd positions and choose the smallest number.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, we just iterate our numbers once, space complexity is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostToMoveChips(self, P):
        return min((odd := sum(1 for p in P if p%2)), len(P) - odd)
```
