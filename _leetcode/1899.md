tags: [greedy, array]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-triplets-to-form-target-triplet/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-triplets-to-form-target-triplet/

#### Solution
Nice and clean problem where one idea can solve all. The idea is to take as much tuples as possible, but keep in mind that some of them are forbidden. By forbidden I mean, that if we take this tuple, then maximum in one of the `3` places will be greater that what we need to get. So, algorithm looks like this:

1. Iterate over all triplets once and create `forbidden` set.
2. Iterate over all triplets once again and update maximums.
3. Check that what we have in the end is equal to what we want.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, because we traverse our triplets twice. Space complexity is `O(n)` as well to keep `forbidden` set.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTriplets(self, triplets, T):
        forbidden = set()
        for i, [x, y, z] in enumerate(triplets):
            if x > T[0] or y > T[1] or z > T[2]:
                forbidden.add(i)
        
        a, b, c = 0, 0, 0
        for i, (x, y, z) in enumerate(triplets):
            if i not in forbidden:
                a, b, c = max(a, x), max(b, y), max(c, z)
                
        return [a, b, c] == T
