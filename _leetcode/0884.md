tags: [string, counter]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/

#### Solution
What is actually asked is to find all words, such that their frequency is equal to `1`. Let us concatenate two strings, and then split it and apply Counter function.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(M + N)`, where `M` and `N` are lengths of strings `A` and `B` and space complexity is `O(M + N)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def uncommonFromSentences(self, A, B):
        return[w for w, f in Counter((A+" "+B).split()).items() if f==1]
```
