title: Leetcode 0402 Remove K Digits
tags: [stack, greedy]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/

#### Solution
The idea is to build the biggest number using stack and greedy algorithm.  Traverse all digits from `num` and for each of them check if it is worth to remove first some last digits from our stack: if we removed digit, decrease `attempt` (equal to `k` at the beginning) by `1`. In the end we possibly need to remove some last symbols, so overall we have `k` removed symbols and also remove all leading zeroes. 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num, k):
        attempts, stack = k, []
        
        for digit in num:
            while stack and digit < stack[-1] and attempts > 0:
                stack.pop()
                attempts -= 1
            stack.append(digit)
        
        out = "".join(stack[0:len(num)-k]).lstrip("0")
        return "0" if out == "" else out 
```
