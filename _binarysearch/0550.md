#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Unique-Integers-in-Sorted-List/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Unique-Integers-in-Sorted-List/

#### Solution 1
Just use set here.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(k)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        return len(set(nums))
```


#### Solution 2
Or we can use binary search to make big steps here.

#### Complexity
It is `O(k log n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        ans, i = 0, 0
        while i < len(nums):
            if i < len(nums) - 1 and nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:
                i = bisect_right(nums, nums[i])
            else:
                i += 1
            ans += 1
        return ans
```
