title: Leetcode 1533 Find the Index of the Large Integer
tags: [binary search, interactive]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-large-integer/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-large-integer/

#### Solution
Let us on each step split array into two parts of equal size. For example if length is equal to `7`, we split is as `3 - 1 - 3` and if it is `6`, we split as `3 - 3`. If it happen, that answer for query is `0`, it means that element we are looking for is in the middle, in opposite case we choose one of the parts.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def getIndex(self, rd):
        beg, end = 0, rd.length() - 1
        while beg < end:
            ln = (end - beg + 1)//2
            query = rd.compareSub(beg, beg + ln - 1, end - ln + 1, end)
            if query == 0: return beg + ln
            if query == -1:
                beg = end - ln + 1
            else:
                end = beg + ln - 1
         
        return end
```

### 1538 Guess the Majority in a Hidden Array

[array, math, interactive]

#### Solution
The idea is that in `O(1)` we can check for any two elements if they are equal or not. Let us do it for pairs `[0, 1]`, `[1, 2]`, ..., `[n-2, n-1]`. And recunstruct array `arr` - notice that it is reconstructed uniquily with espect of swap of all elements. Then we find majority element.

#### Complexity
We do `2n - 2` queries and we have `O(n)` time and space complexity.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def guessMajority(self, reader):
        n = reader.length()
        arr = [0]
        for x in range(0, n-1):
            att1 = sorted([(x-3)%n, (x-2)%n, (x-1)%n, x])
            att2 = sorted([(x-3)%n, (x-2)%n, (x-1)%n, x+1])
            t1 = reader.query(*att1)
            t2 = reader.query(*att2)
            arr += [arr[-1]] if t1 == t2 else [1 - arr[-1]]
        
        sm = sum(arr)
        return arr.index(0) if sm*2 < n else arr.index(1) if sm*2 > n else -1
```

#### Remark
We can do only `n` queries in the way `[0,1,2,3], [0,1,2,4], [0,1,2,5], ..., [0,1,2,n-1]` and `[0,1,3,4], [0,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4]` so we can recover all values. Space complexity can be reduced to `O(1)`, if we use voting. 

Moreover there is solution with `n//2 + 4` steps I think
