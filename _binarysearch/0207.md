#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-1s-After-One-Swap/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-1s-After-One-Swap/

#### Solution
Variation of Leetcode 0487. Max Consecutive Ones II, we just need to check in the end that answer is no more than total number of ones.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        ans, n, zeroes = 0, len(A), 0
        beg, end = 0, 0
        while end < n:
            if end < n and zeroes + (A[end] == "0")  <= 1:
                zeroes += (A[end] == "0")
                end += 1
                ans = max(ans, end - beg)
            else:
                zeroes -= (A[beg] == "0")
                beg += 1

        return min(ans, A.count("1"))
```
