#### Solution
The question is asked in this problem: given tree, how many ways there is to traverse it, so we traverse children after it parent. Imagine example: we have tree with root with `3` children, such that we have `10` nodes in total and `2, 4, 3` nodes for left, middle and right children. Then how many ways there is to traverse the tree? Let `dp(i)` be number of answers for subtree with node `i`. Then for the specific case we considered we can say that `dp(0) = dp(1)*dp(2)*dp(3)*C_9^{2,4,3}`, where `C_9^{2,4,3}` is multinomial coefficient = `9!/2!/4!/3!`. Why it is so? Because we have `9` possible places to put `2` nodes of first type (left), `4` nodes of the second type (middle) and `3` nodes of the third type (right). Also we need to calculate number of solutions for smaller subproblems.

Here function `dp(node)` will return two values: first one is the size of subtree with this node and the second one is number of possible ways to built colony with root in this node. I precalculated all factorials and inverse factorials outside function: so in fact it is done only once. Here I use trick to evaluate inverses of all numbers from `1` to `M` in linear time, but actually we do not need this, we just need inverses of factorials which can be done simpler: evaluate inverse of `M!` and then multiply it to get inverse of `(M-1)!` and so on.

#### Complexity
Time complexity `O(M)` to calculate all factorials and inverses but we do it only once for **all** tests. Then we have `O(n)` to traverse our tree. Space complexity is `O(M + n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    MOD, M = 10**9 + 7, 10**5
    inverses, inverse_fact, facts = [1]*(M+1), [1]*(M+1), [1]*(M+1)
    for a in range(2, M + 1):
        inverses[a] = MOD - ((MOD // a) * inverses[MOD % a]) % MOD

    for i in range(1, M+1):
        inverse_fact[i] = (inverse_fact[i-1] * inverses[i]) % MOD
        facts[i] = (facts[i-1] * i) % MOD

    def waysToBuildRooms(self, prevRoom):
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for i, num in enumerate(prevRoom):
            graph[num].append(i)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(node):
            ans, sm = 1, 1
            for neib in graph[node]:
                ans2, sm2 = dp(neib)
                ans = (ans * self.inverse_fact[sm2] * ans2) % self.MOD
                sm += sm2
            return ((ans * self.facts[sm-1]) % self.MOD, sm)

        return dp(0)[0]
