#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/


#### Solution
Denote by `dp[mask]` possibility to put numbers with mask `mask` into our subsets. In more detais: we return `-1` if this partition is not possible and we return `t >= 0`, if it is possible, where `t` is reminder when we divide sum of all used numbers so far by `basket`: value, of how many we need to put in each group. Then to check if we can do it, we need to check the last number we put and check `n` possible options, where `n` is number of nums. 

#### Complexity
Overall time complexity is $(2^n \cdot n)$ and space complexity is $O(2^n)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def canPartitionKSubsets(self, nums, k):
        N = len(nums)
        nums.sort(reverse = True)

        basket, rem = divmod(sum(nums), k)
        if rem or nums[0] > basket: return False

        dp = [-1] * (1<<N) 
        dp[0] = 0
        for mask in range(1<<N):
            for j in range(N):
                neib = dp[mask ^ (1<<j)]
                if mask & (1<<j) and neib >= 0 and neib + nums[j] <= basket:
                    dp[mask] = (neib + nums[j]) % basket
                    break

        return dp[-1] == 0
```
