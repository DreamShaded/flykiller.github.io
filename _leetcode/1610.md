#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-visible-points/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-visible-points/

#### Solution
The idea is to sort points by polar angle - in python we can use function `atan2`, which given that coordinates of points no more than 100 will work fine in double domain. Then we use two pointers approach to find how many points we have in sliding window, also we add one more circle of shifted by `2pi` points to our angles.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def visiblePoints(self, points, angle, L):
        points_cnt = Counter([(x,y) for x, y in points])
        shift = points_cnt[tuple(L)]
        A1 = sorted([atan2(y-L[1], x-L[0]) for x, y in points if (x, y) != tuple(L)])
        A2 = [a + 2*pi for a in A1]
        
        A, n, ans, end_index = A1 + A2, len(A1), 0, 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            border = A[i] + angle/180*pi
            while A[end_index] <= border: 
                end_index += 1
            ans = max(end_index - i, ans)
    
        return ans + shift
```
#### Remark
If we want to avoid rounding error and original points are integer, then we can use the following:

```python
def quater(p):
    x, y = p
    if x >= 0 and y >= 0: return 2
    if x < 0 and y >= 0: return 1
    if x < 0 and y < 0: return 4
    if x >= 0 and y < 0: return 3

def compare(p1, p2):
    if quater(p1) == quater(p2):
        t1 = p1[1]*p2[0] - p2[1]*p1[0]
        return 0 if t1 == 0 else 1 if t1 > 0 else -1
    else:
        return 1 if quater(p1) < quater(p2) else -1
```

In this way points will be sorted from angle `(-180, 180)` without rounding errors. However in this specific problem we can not fully get rid of doubles, because we need to compare with angle, for which we need to evaluate tangent, and compare it with oriented angle between points. But for other angular sweep problem it can be useful.
