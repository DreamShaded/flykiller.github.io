title: Leetcode 0983. Minimum Cost For Tickets

There are a lot of different dp solution, which have `O(days)` complexity, which is in fact `O(30*days)`, so it depeneds a lot on our numbers `[1,7,30]`. My solution is universal: you can choose any passes you want, and time complexity will not depend on them. Let me introduce my notations:

1. `k` is number of passes and `P` is durations of these passes, in our case it is `[1,7,30]`; cost is minimal cost so far, in the beginning it is equal to `0`.
2. `Q` is list of `k` queues. Why we need queues? When we want to find the best cost we can have at some day `d`, we need to look back `30` days before, so why not keep all these period in queue? What we keep in this queue? We keep pairs `[day, cost]`. Also we have queue for `7` day pass and for `1` day pass.

Let us go through example for better understanding:
`days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]`.


1. `day = 1`, `Q[0] = [[1,2]], Q[1] = [[1,7]], Q[2] = [[1, 15]]`: for the first day we put it in all three queues.
2. `day = 4`, `Q[0] = [[4,4]], Q[1] = [[1,7], [4,9]], Q[2] = [[1,15], [4,17]]`: we update `Q[0]`, also `Q[1]` and `Q[2]` now have two elements.
3. `day = 6`, `Q[0] = [[6,6]], Q[1] = [[1,7], [4, 9], [6,11]], Q[2] = [[1,15], [4,17], [6,19]]`: update `Q[0]`, add element to `Q[1]` and `Q[2]`. 
4. `day = 7`, `Q[0] = [[7,8]], Q[1] = [[1,7], [4,9], [6,11], [7,13]], Q[2] = [[1,15], [4,17], [6,19], [7,21]]`, similar logic.
5. `day = 8`, `Q[0] = [[8,9]], Q[1] = [[4,9], [6,11], [7,13], [8,14]], Q[2] = [[1,15], [4,17], [6,19], [7,21], [8,22]]`: update `Q[0]`, also add element to the end of `Q[1]` and remove element from the beginning of `Q[1]`, because it is outdated.
6. `day = 20`, `Q[0] = [[20,11]], Q[1] = [[20,16]], Q[2] = [[1,15], [4,17], [6,19], [7,21], [8,22], [20,24]]`.

So, we iterate through our days and update our queues on each step. Then we choose minimum possible result.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(days)`, length of `days` list, because we process each element at most `3` times: we can put and remove it to each queue only once. For general case complexity is `O(days * k)`.  Space complexity is `O(30+7+1)` in our case and `O(sum(P))` in general case.



```
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days, costs):
        k, P, cost = 3, [1,7,30], 0
        Q = [deque() for _ in range(k)]

        for d in days:
            for i in range(k):
                while Q[i] and Q[i][0][0] + P[i] <= d: Q[i].popleft()
                Q[i].append([d, cost + costs[i]])
         
            cost = min([Q[i][0][1] for i in range(k)])

        return cost
```

**Remark** I think this problem is similar to problem **264. Ugly Number II**, there we also need to keep several candidates for new number and update them.
