#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-function/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-function/

#### Solution
Let us evaluate `F(0)` in `O(n)` time. We can see, that `F(1) = F(0) + S - n * A[-1]`, `F(2) = F(1) + S - n * A[-2]` and so on. So, we can evaluate each next `F(i) in `O(1)` and update maximum. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxRotateFunction(self, A):
        n, s = len(A), sum(A)
        F = sum(x*y for x, y in zip(A, range(n)))
        ans = F
        for i in range(1, n):
            F += s - n*A[-i]
            ans = max(ans, F)
        return ans
```
