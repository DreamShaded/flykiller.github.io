title: Leetcode 0268. Missing Number
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0268/

This problem is a simple version of the problem **645. Set Mismatch**, so if you solved it previously, this one will be easy. Here you can look at my solution:

https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/discuss/1089475/python-on-timeo1-space-math-solution-explained

The idea is the following: let us sum all numbers between `1` and `n` and then subtract sum of all `nums` and in the end we will have exaclty number we need.

Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        return len(nums)*(len(nums)+1)//2 - sum(nums)
```
