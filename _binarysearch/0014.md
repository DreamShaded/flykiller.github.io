#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sliding-Window-Max/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sliding-Window-Max/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode Leetcode 0239. Sliding Window Maximum

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, because we iterate over our elements and for each element it can be put inside and outside of our deque only once. Space complexity is `O(k)`, the maximum size of our deque.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        deq, n, ans = deque([0]), len(nums), []

        for i in range (n):
            if deq[0] <= i - k:
                deq.popleft()
            while deq and nums[i] >= nums[deq[-1]] :
                deq.pop()
            deq.append(i)
            ans.append(nums[deq[0]])
            
        return ans[k-1:]
```
