This is easy prolem, where you need just to do what is asked, without really thinking.

1. Split our sentence into words, using `.split()`. If it is not allowed we can just traverse it and find spaces.
2. For every word check if it starts with vowel, if it is, add `ma` and `i+1` letters `a` to the end. It is `i+1`, because we start from zero index.
3. If first letter is not vowel, remove first letter and add it to the end, also add `ma` and letters `a`.

**Complexity**: time and space complexity is `O(n) + O(k^2)`, where `n` is number of symbols in our string and `k` is number of words: do not forget about letters `a` in the end: we add `1 + 2 + ... + k = O(k^2)` letters in the end.

```python
class Solution:
    def toGoatLatin(self, S):
        words = S.split()
        vowels = set("AEIOUaeiou")
        for i in range(len(words)):
            if words[i][0] in vowels:
                words[i] = words[i] + "ma" + "a"*(i+1)
            else:
                words[i] = words[i][1:] + words[i][0] + "ma" + "a"*(i+1)
                
        return " ".join(words)
```
