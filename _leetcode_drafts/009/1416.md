title: Leetcode 1416. Restore The Array
tags: [math, dp, string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-the-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-the-array/

#### Solution
The idea is to use `dp`, where `dp[i]` is number of ways to split array `s[i:]`. Then we can start from the end and try to add digit by digit while it is in range `[1, k]`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n * log(k))` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfArrays(self, s, k):
        n = len(s)
        s = [int(i) for i in s] + [float("inf")]
        dp = [0] * n + [1]
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            num, j = s[i], i + 1
            while 1 <= num <= k and j < n + 1:
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j]) % 1000000007
                num = 10 * num + s[j]
                j += 1
        return dp[0]
```
