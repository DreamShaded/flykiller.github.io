#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Weekly-Contest/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Weekly-Contest/

#### Solution
First of all notice, that if we take tasks in order `(i, j, k)` and in order `(j, i, k)`, then we will get better score for the case where `points_i > points_j` - we can do math and see this. It means, that it is always optimal to take first tasks with bigger `points` (I denote them by `x` and chances denoted by `p`). No, let us consider `dp(i, taken)` state, where we work with `[i, n-1]` tasks, task `i` is taken and also in total we already tried to solve `taken` tasks. 

Then we have $$dp(i, taken) = \max\limits_{i < j \leqslant n} p_i \cdot x_i + (1-p_i) \cdot dp(j, taken - 1)$$

It total we have `O(n * k)` states with `O(n)` time to compute state, which is not enough to pass. However we can also calculate accumulate maximum of suffixes, which will lead to total `O(n * k)` time.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n * k)` as well as space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, points, chances, k):
        xp = sorted((x, p/100) for x, p in zip(points, chances))[::-1]
        n = len(xp)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, taken):
            if taken == 0: return 0
            if i == n: return -float("inf")
            return xp[i][0]*xp[i][1] + (1 - xp[i][1]) * mp(i + 1, taken - 1)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def mp(i, taken):
            if i == n: return 0
            return max(mp(i + 1, taken), dp(i, taken))

        return max([int(dp(i, k)) for i in range(n-k+1)] or [0])
```

#### Code 2
In fact it can be written in shorter way if we define state `dp(i, taken)` as [i, n-1]` tasks, (task `i` can be taken or not taken) and also in total we already tried to solve `taken` tasks. Complexity is the same.
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, points, chances, k):
        xp = sorted((x, p/100) for x, p in zip(points, chances))[::-1]
        n = len(xp)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, k):
            if k == 0 or i == n: return 0
            x, p = xp[i]
            return max(x*p + dp(i + 1, k - 1) * (1 - p), dp(i + 1, k))

        return int(dp(0, k))
```
