tags: [math, geometry]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/

#### Solution
We need to solve two separate problems: for each of dimensions. See also **0223** Rectangle Area problem, this one is special case.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isRectangleOverlap(self, rec1, rec2):
        A, B, C, D = rec1
        E, F, G, H = rec2
        return not min(C,G) <= max(A,E) and not min(D,H) <= max(B,F)
```
