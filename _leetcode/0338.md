title: Leetcode 0338. Counting Bits
tags: []
---

This problem is to combine dynamic programming and bit manipulations.
Let us consider the example of `n = 13`. First create `dp` table and fill it with zeros. Then:
1. Number `1 = 1` we can say, that it have 1 non-zero bit. 
2. Numbers `2 = 10, 3 = 11` have two digits in binary representation and first of them is equal to `1`, so to count number of non-zero bits in this numbers, we subtract `2` from them and look into cells `0 = 00` and `1 = 01` of our table.
3. Numbers `4 = 100, 5 = 101, 6 = 110, 7 = 111` have three digits in binary representation, so we need to look into cells `0 = 000, 1 = 001, 2 = 010` and `3 = 001`.
4. Finally for numbers `8 = 1000, 9 = 1001, 10 = 1010, 11 = 1011, 12 = 1100, 13 = 1101` we look into cells `0 = 0000, 1 = 0001, 2 = 0010, 3 = 0011, 4 = 0100, 5 = 0101`. Note, that we need to interrupt earlier here, because we reached the end of our list.

**Complexity** We build our table in such way, that we do it in `O(1)` for each cell. So, both time and memory is `O(n)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, num):
        dp = [0] * (num + 1)
        for pow in range(0, 32):
            start, end = 1<<pow, 1<<(pow + 1)
            if start > num: break

            for j in range(start, min(num+1,end)):
                dp[j] = dp[j-start] + 1
        return dp  
```
