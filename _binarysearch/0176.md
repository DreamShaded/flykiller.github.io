#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Reverse-Linked-List-Groups/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Reverse-Linked-List-Groups/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0025. Reverse Nodes in k-Group, but be careful about the last group, it is not said in problem description what we need to do with it.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, head, k):
        dummy = LLNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        cur, nxt, pre = dummy, dummy, dummy
        cnt = 0
        while cur.next:
            cnt += 1
            cur = cur.next
            
        while cnt > 0:
            cur = new = pre.next
            nxt = cur.next
            for _ in range(min(k, cnt) - 1):
                tmp = nxt.next
                nxt.next = cur
                cur = nxt
                nxt = tmp
            
            pre.next = cur
            new.next = nxt
            pre = new
            cnt -= k
            
        return dummy.next
```
