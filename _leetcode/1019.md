title: Leetcode 1019. Next Greater Node In Linked List
tags: [stack, monotonic deque]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-node-in-linked-list/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-node-in-linked-list/

#### Solution
Let us just put all elements in `nums` and then reuse classical next greater element problem with monotone decreasing stack. Or when we traverse we can put elements on the flight.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def nextLargerNodes(self, head):
        nums, stack = [], []
        while head:
            nums += [head.val]
            head = head.next
            
        n = len(nums)
        result = [0]*n
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            while stack and stack[-1][1] < num:
                a, b = stack.pop()
                result[a] = num
            stack.append((i, num))
            
        return result
```
