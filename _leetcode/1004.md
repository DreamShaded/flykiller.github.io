title: Leetcode 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III
tags: [array, sliding window]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/

#### Solution
In this problem what we actually asked is to find window of maximum size with number of zeroes no more than `k`. So, let us use sliding window approach with window `[beg, end)` and `zeroes` is number of zeroes in this window. 
1. If we try to add element `nums[end]` to our window and we still have number of zeroes `<=k`, we do it and move `end` point to the right and update `zeroes` and `ans`.
2. In the opposite case it means that we can not extend our sliding window to the right, so we shrink it left pointer `beg` and again update number of zeroes inside.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, because `beg` and `end` in total travel `2n` times. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums, k):
        beg, end, zeroes, ans = 0, 0, 0, 0
        while end < len(nums):
            if zeroes + (nums[end] == 0) <= k:
                zeroes += nums[end] == 0
                end += 1
                ans = max(ans, end - beg)
            else:
                zeroes -= nums[beg] == 0
                beg += 1  
        return ans
```
