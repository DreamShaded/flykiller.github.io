title: Leetcode 0559 Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree
tags: [tree, dfs, bfs]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/

#### Solution
Just traverse tree with for example dfs.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `$(h+N)`, where `h` is height of tree and `N` is maximum number of children of any node.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        if not root: return 0
        depth = 0
        for child in root.children:
            depth = max(depth, self.maxDepth(child))
        return depth + 1
```
