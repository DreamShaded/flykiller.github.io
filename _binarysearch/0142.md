#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Interleaved-Linked-List/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Interleaved-Linked-List/

#### Solution
Just use two pointers, choosing one list or another. In the end attach the tail.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n + m)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, l0, l1):
        head = tail = LLNode(-1)
        step = 0
        while l0 and l1:
            if step%2 == 0:
                tail.next = l0
                l0 = l0.next
            else:
                tail.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            tail = tail.next
            step += 1
        
        if l1: tail.next = l1
        if l0: tail.next = l0
        
        return head.next
```
