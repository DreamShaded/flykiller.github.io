#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-rotation-with-highest-score/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-rotation-with-highest-score/

#### Solution 1
One solution is to use SortedList: on the first moment of time we need to check how many elements there in `[A[i] - i]` such that they are `<= 0`. When we need have numbers `[A[i] - i + 1]` and we need to find how many of them `<= 0`, which is equivalent to find how many numbers from `[A[i] - i]` are `<= -1` where we updated one element `A[0] -> A[0] - n`. Then we do it again and again.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class Solution:
    def bestRotation(self, A):
        B = [a - i for i,a in enumerate(A)]
        n, ans, SList = len(A), (0, -1), SortedList(B)

        for i in range(n):
            ans = max(ans, (SortedList.bisect(SList, -i), -i))
            SList.remove(B[i])
            SList.add(B[i]-n)
            
        return -ans[1]
```

#### Solution 2
There is also `O(n)` smart solution, using intervals: note, that for every number `A[i]` there will be continuous interval of `K` for which it will give us a point (or continuous but with transition `n-1 -> 0`). So, now we have the following problem: we have several intervals and we need to find the first index with maximum number of overlappings. We can find that for `i`-th point interval will be `[(i+1)\%n, (i-A[i])\%n]`, so we use trick with cumulative sums: for `[a, b]` we increase `a`-th element by `1` and decrease `(b+1)`-th element by one.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def bestRotation(self, A):
        n = len(A)
        good = [0]*n
        for i in range(n):
            beg, end = (i+1)%n, (i-A[i]+1)%n
            good[end] -= 1
            good[beg] += 1
        
        t = list(accumulate(good))
        return t.index(max(t))
```

#### Remark
Moreover, it is not really necessary to update beg on each iteration: it will be updated exactly $n$ times for each position, so we can start with `good = [1]*n`.
