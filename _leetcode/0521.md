title: Leetcode 0521 Longest Uncommon Subsequence I
tags: [string]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-i/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-i/

#### Solution
Just check if words are equal or not. If they are equal, return `-1`. If they are not, return maximum of their lengths.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(max(m, n))`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findLUSlength(self, a, b):
        return -1 if a == b else max(len(a), len(b))
```
