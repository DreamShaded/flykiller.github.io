#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rabbits-in-forest/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/rabbits-in-forest/

#### Solution
Note, that for if some of the rabbits says number `i`, than there is group of `i+1` rabbits with one color. So, if we have `1, 2, ..., i+1` of them saying `i`, minimal number of rabbits for this group is `i+1`, if we have `i+2, ..., 2i+2`, minimal number of rabbits is `2i+2`: there should be `2` groups. In general it can be written as `(j+i)//(i+1)*(i+1)` if we have `j` rabbits which said `i`. 

#### Complexity
Finally, all this can be written in oneliner, using counters, time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numRabbits(self, answers):
        return sum((j+i)//(i+1)*(i+1) for i,j in Counter(answers).items())
```
