#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/confusing-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/confusing-number/

#### Solution
Create hash table of connections and then check definition: apply `d` for every digit and reverse it. Also deal with case when we have `#` symbol.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(m)`, where `m` is nubmer of digits in `n`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def confusingNumber(self, n):
        s = str(n)
        d = {"0" : "0", "1" : "1", "6" : "9", "8" : "8", "9" : "6"}
        s1 = "".join(d.get(c,"#") for c in s[::-1])     
        return s1 != s and "#" not in s1  
```
