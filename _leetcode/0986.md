title: Leetcode 0986. Interval List Intersections
tags: [two pointers, intervals]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/

#### Solution
Intervals are already sorted, so what we can do is use two pointers technique: take intervals `i` and `j` and try to create intersection. If it is not empty, add it to answer. Then we decide, which interval to choose next, we move the one which ends earlier (if we move the one which starts earlier, we can loose some parts, draw some examples and make sure).

#### Complexity

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def intervalIntersection(self, A, B):
        i, j, ans = 0, 0, []
        while i < len(A) and j < len(B):
            curr = [max(A[i][0], B[j][0]), min(A[i][1], B[j][1])]
            if curr[0] <= curr[1]:
                ans += [curr]
            if A[i][1] <= B[j][1]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1

        return ans
```
