title: BinarySearch 0573 Lexicographically Bigger String
tags: [string, sort, greedy]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Lexicographically-Bigger-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Lexicographically-Bigger-String/

#### Solution
We need to sort string and compare: it can be proved that this greedy strategy works.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, t):
        s, t = sorted(s), sorted(t)
        if sum(x < y for x, y in zip(s, t)) == 0: return True
        if sum(x < y for x, y in zip(t, s)) == 0: return True
        return False
```
