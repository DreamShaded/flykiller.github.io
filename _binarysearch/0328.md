#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/123-Number-Flip/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/123-Number-Flip/

#### Solution
We need to flip to `3` the first digit we have, which is not equal to `3`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(k)` for time and space, where `k` is number of digits in `n`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        s = str(n)
        for i, elem in enumerate(s):
            if s[i] != "3":
                return int(s[:i] + "3" + s[i+1:])
        
        return n
```
