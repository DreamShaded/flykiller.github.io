#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Max-Product-of-Two-Numbers/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Max-Product-of-Two-Numbers/

#### Solution
We can sort number and then choose between product of smallest two and biggest two. Almost the same as Leetcode 1464. Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space. Notice that time can be made `O(n)` in fact.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        nums = sorted(nums)
        a1, a2 = nums[0], nums[1]
        b1, b2 = nums[-2], nums[-1]
        return max(a1 * a2, b1 * b2)
```
