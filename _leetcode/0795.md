title: Leetcode 0795. Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum
tags: [array, two pointers]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subarrays-with-bounded-maximum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subarrays-with-bounded-maximum/

#### Solution
Let us iterate through numbers and keep index of last number which is `>= L` and index of last number, which is `> R`. Then, we can quickly calculate number of subarrays with bounded maximum which ends on symbol with index `i`: in our window at least one number `>= L`, no numbers `> R`, so we calculate`L_ind - R_ind`. Note, that this number can never be negative, because if `num > R` then `num >= L` since L <= R.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayBoundedMax(self, A, L, R):
        L_ind, R_ind, ans = -1, -1, 0
        for i, num in enumerate(A):
            if num >= L: L_ind = i
            if num > R:  R_ind = i
            ans += L_ind - R_ind
        return ans
```
