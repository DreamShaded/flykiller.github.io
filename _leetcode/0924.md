#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-malware-spread/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-malware-spread/

#### Solution
The idea is the following: given graph, we need to:
1. Find all connected components and for each component we need to know size of it.
2. For each component we need to know how many infected nodes inside: if it is more than one, we are not intersted in this component.
3. Among all components, where we have exaclty one infected node, we need to choose one with the smallest tuple `(-size, index of node)`.
4. In the end, if we did not found any component with only one infected node, we retrun index of smallest node, in the opposite case we return what we found.

Dictionary `comps` are connections `node -> index of component`.

Counter `sizes` are connections `index of component -> size of it`.

Counter `comps_count` are connections `index of component -> number of infected nodes`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n + E)` to traverse all graph, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minMalwareSpread(self, graph, initial):
        n, V, comps, cnt = len(graph), set(), {}, 0
        
        def dfs(node, i):
            comps[node] = i
            V.add(node)
            for neib in range(n):
                if graph[node][neib] == 0 or neib in V: continue
                dfs(neib, i)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in V:
                dfs(i, cnt)
                cnt += 1
                
        sizes = Counter(comps.values())
                
        comps_count = Counter()
        for node in initial:
            comps_count[comps[node]] += 1
            
        ans = (n + 1, float("inf"))
                
        for node in initial:
            c = comps[node]
            if comps_count[c] != 1: continue
            ans = min(ans, (-sizes[c], node))
            
        return ans[1] if ans[1] != float("inf") else min(initial)
```

### 1622 Fancy Sequence

[math, design]

#### Solution
The trick is here to keep so-called lazy updates: we will keep `3` pieces of information:
1. `self.A` is multiplication coefficient
2. `self.B` is summation coefficient
3. `self.T` is array,

such that we have `nums = self.A*self.T + self.B`.

1. To get `addAll`, we just need to increment `self.B`.
2. To get `multAll`, we juet need to multiply both `self.A` and `self.B`.
3. To get `getIndex`, evaluate `self.T[idx]*self.A + self.B`
4. Finally, to get `append`, when we add `val`, we need to solve equation `self.T[n] = (val - self.B) * self.A`, so we need to solve this equation moduly `M`.

#### Complexity
Time complexities of `addAll`, `multAll` and `getIndex` is `O(1)`. Time complexity of `append` is `O(log M)` to perform inverse of element. Space complexity is `O(n)` for full data structure.

#### Code
```python
class Fancy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.T, self.A, self.B = [], 1, 0
        self.M = 10**9 + 7

    def append(self, val):
        self.T += [(val - self.B)*pow(self.A, -1, self.M) % self.M]

    def addAll(self, inc):
        self.B = (self.B + inc) % self.M
        
    def multAll(self, m):
        self.A = (self.A * m) % self.M
        self.B = (self.B * m) % self.M

    def getIndex(self, idx):
        return (self.T[idx]*self.A + self.B) % self.M if idx < len(self.T) else -1
```
