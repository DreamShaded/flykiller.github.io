One way to solve this problem is to create new string with only alphanumeric symbols and then check if it is palindrome. However we need `O(n)` space for this. There is more subtle approach, using **Two Pointers** technique.

1. Start with `beg = 0` and `end = len(s) - 1`, the first and the last symbols of string `s`.
2. Now, we are going to move iterator `beg` only to the right and iterator `end` only to the left. Let us move them, until we reach alphanumeric symbols, using `isalnum()` function.
3. Compare these two symbols. We are happy, if they are equal, or it is the same letter in different capitalization, for example `q` and `Q`. How to check this case? Make both symbols capitalized, using `.upper()` and compare them.
4. In opposite case, immidietly return `False`.
5. If we reached the end of or program and we did not return `False`, then we need to return `True`.

**Complexity**: Time complexity is `O(n)`, because we move `beg` only to the right and `end` only to the left, until they meet. Space complexity is `O(1)`, we just use a couple of additional variables.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s):
        beg, end = 0, len(s) - 1
        while beg <= end:
            while not s[beg].isalnum() and beg < end: beg += 1
            while not s[end].isalnum() and beg < end: end -= 1
            if s[beg] == s[end] or s[beg].upper() == s[end].upper():
                beg, end = beg + 1, end - 1
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
