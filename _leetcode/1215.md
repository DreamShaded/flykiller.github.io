#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/single-row-keyboard/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/single-row-keyboard/

#### Solution
We can use bfs approach here: add numbers `[0, 1, ..., 9]` to queue and each time we extract number `num` from the left, we add at most two possible candidates to the right. In this way we can be sure that numbers are sorted. If we have number between `low` and `high`, we add it to answer. Also, if we have `num > high`, we can stop.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(9*2^(k-1))`, where `k` is maximum number of digits, space complexity as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countSteppingNumbers(self, low, high):
        queue = deque(range(10))
        ans = []
        
        while queue:
            num = queue.popleft()
            if low <= num <= high: ans += [num]
            if num > high: return ans
            last_digit = num % 10
            if num == 0: continue
            for new in [last_digit - 1, last_digit + 1]:
                if 0 <= new <= 9:
                    queue.append(num*10 + new)
```
