title: Leetcode 0104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0104/
---

This is classical problem about tree traversal and there are as usual 2 different approach how you can do it (bfs and dfs) and we can choose whatever you want. Recursive dfs will provide us with the shortest code, so I chose this one.

1. If we reached `None` node, it means we need to return depth equal to `0`.
2. In other case, we check depths of left and right subtrees and return maximum of them plus one.


**Complexity**: As for usual dfs approach, time complexity is `O(n)` and space complexity is `O(h)`, where `h` is height of our tree.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        if not root: return 0
        return max(self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right)) + 1
```
