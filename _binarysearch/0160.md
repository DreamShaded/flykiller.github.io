#### Problem statement

#### Solution
First of all if all values are the same, we can not do any steps.
Also we have invariant: `count(R) - count(B)` and `count(B) - count(G)` will not change their values modulo `2`. It means that if we have say `odd, odd, odd`, then we can have in the end `odd, odd, odd` or `even, even, even`. Because we can not have `0` in the end, the minimum value we can have is `2` in this case. This was an estimate, how about example?

The key insight is that, if you have 4 contiguous quxes and not all of them are equal, you can always transform two of them such that the 3 quxes left are also not equal. In this way we always can reduce problem to `3` quexes and then it can be either `1` or `2`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        r, g, b, n = A.count("R"), A.count("G"), A.count("B"), len(A)
        if r == n or g == n or b == n:
            return n
        else:
            if r % 2 == g % 2 == b % 2:
                return 2
            else:
                return 1
```
