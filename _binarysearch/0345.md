#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        heapify(nums)
        ans = 0
        for _ in range(len(nums) - 1):
            a, b = heappop(nums), heappop(nums)
            ans += (a + b)
            heappush(nums, a + b)

        return ans
```
