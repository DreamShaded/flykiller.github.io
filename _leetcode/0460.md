#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/

#### Solution
[code and explanation is borrowed from `https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/discuss/207673/Python-concise-solution-**detailed**-explanation%3A-Two-dict-%2B-Doubly-linked-list`]

Let us use circled double linked list, that is where last elements points to the first. Also we use dummy node to deal with edge cases. For our doubly linked list we can:

1. `append(node)`: append the node to the head of the linked list.
2. `pop(node = None)`: remove the referenced node. If `None` is given, remove the one from tail, which is the least recently used.

Now, let us consider our LFUCache class:

###### **Function** `__init__`
3 things to maintain:
1. a dict, named as `self._node`, for the reference of all nodes given key. That is, `O(1)` time to retrieve node given a key.
2. Each frequency has a doubly linked list, store in `self._freq`, where key is the frequency, and value is an object of `DList`
3. The min frequency through all nodes. We can maintain this in `O(1)` time, taking advantage of the fact that the frequency can only increment by 1. Use the followingtwo rules:

Rule 1: Whenever we see the size of the `DList` of current min frequency is `0`, the min frequency must increment by `1`.

Rule 2: Whenever put in a new `(key, value)`, the min frequency must be equal to 1 (the new node)

###### **Function** `_update(self, node)`: 
This is a helper function that used in the following two cases: 

1. when `get(key)` is called and 
2. when `put(key, value)` is called and the key exists.

The common point of these two cases is that 

1. no new node comes in, and 
2. the node is visited one more times `-> node.freq` changed thus the place of this node will change.

The logic of this function is:

1. pop the node from the old DList (with freq `f`)
2. append the node to new DList (with freq `f+1`)
3. if old `DList` has size `0` and `self._minfreq` is `f`, update `self._minfreq` to `f+1`.

###### **Function** `get(key)`
Through checking `self._node[key]`, we can get the node in `O(1)` time. Just performs `self._update`, then we can return the value of node.

###### **Function** `put(key, value)`
If `key` already exists in `self._node`, we do the same operations as `get`, except updating the `node.val` to new value. Otherwise, the following logic will be performed

1. if the cache reaches its capacity, pop the least frequently used item.  How we pop it: we maintain the `self._minfreq`, the minimum possible frequency in cache. All cache with the same frequency are stored as a DList with recently used order (Always append at head). So, the tail of the `DList` with `self._minfreq` is the least recently used one, pop it.
2. add new node to `self._node`
3. add new node to the `DList` with frequency `1`
4. reset `self._minfreq` to `1`

#### Complexity
Time complexity of all operations is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, key = None, val=0, freq = 1, nxt=None, prv=None):
        self.val = val

        node.prev.next = node.next
        node.next.prev = node.prev

    def _update(self, node):
        freq = node.freq
        
        self._freq[freq].pop(node)
        if self._minfreq == freq and not self._freq[freq]:
            self._minfreq += 1
        
        node.freq += 1
        freq = node.freq
        self._freq[freq].append(node)
    
    def get(self, key):
        if key not in self._node: return -1
        
        node = self._node[key]
        self._update(node)
        return node.val

    def put(self, key, value):
        if self._capacity == 0:
            return
        
        if key in self._node:
            node = self._node[key]
            self._update(node)
            node.val = value
        else:
            if self._size == self._capacity:
                node = self._freq[self._minfreq].pop()
                del self._node[node.key]
                self._size -= 1
                
            node = ListNode(key, value)
            self._node[key] = node
            self._freq[1].append(node)
            self._minfreq = 1
            self._size += 1
```
