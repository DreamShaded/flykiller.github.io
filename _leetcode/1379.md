title: Leetcode 1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree
tags: []
---

Let us find path to our node in `original` tree and write it down to `self.path` list: `0` for left turn and `1` for right turn. Let us use `dfs` function, which returns if given node is in path between root and given `node`.
1. We need to stop if we reached `None` node, in this case we return `False`. If we met `node == target`, then we return `True`.
2. Visit left and right nodes: `L = dfs(node.left)` and `R = dfs(node.right)`. 
3. If both of them are `False`, it means we do not need to visit any of them, we do nothing. If one of them is `True` and another is `False`, then we need to choose the one with target. It can not happen, that both of them are `True`.
4. Finally, we create empty `self.path`, run our `dfs` and what we will have in the end is path to `target` node, but in reversed order. So, we start with `cloned` node and follow this path.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)` to potentially visit all nodes (I think there is not way to improve it, because we do not have parent links, so we need to find `target` node at least). Space complexity is `O(h)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def getTargetCopy(self, original, cloned, target):
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return False
            if node == target: return True
            L, R = dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right)
            if L or R: self.path += [0] if L else [1]
            return L or R
        
        self.path = []
        dfs(original)
        for i in self.path[::-1]:
            cloned = cloned.left if i == 0 else cloned.right
        
        return cloned
```
