#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rotated-digits/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/rotated-digits/

#### Solution
There is straightforward solution with `O(n log n)` complexity, where for every number we just check if it is good or not.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(log n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def rotatedDigits(self, N):
        d1, d2 = set(["0","1","2","5","6","8","9"]), set(["0","1","8"])
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(1, N+1):
            q = set(str(i))
            ans += (int(not(q - d1)) - int(not(q - d2)))
            
        return ans
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(log n)` solution, if we use I call it Digits Build strategy: imagine we have `N = 314792`, than all numbers which are less or equal to `N` can be split into groups: `31479?, 3147?*, 314?**, 31?***, 3?****, ?*****, *****, ****, ***, **, *`, where `*` means any digit and `?` means digit less than digit on corresponding place in original number.
