#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Deleting-Repeated-Integers-Game/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Deleting-Repeated-Integers-Game/

#### Solution
It can be shown that answer depends on number of duplicates: we need 1 step if we have `1` or `2`, we need 2 steps if we have `3` or `4` and so on.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        return (len(nums) - len(set(nums)) + 1)//2
```
