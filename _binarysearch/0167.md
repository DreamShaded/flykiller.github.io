#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Subsequence-Sum/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Subsequence-Sum/

#### Solution
First, create array `arr[i] - i`. Then we allowed to take only equal elements from this array. Iterate over them and update `d`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        nums2 = [x - i for i, x in enumerate(nums)]
        d = Counter()
        for i, x in enumerate(nums2):
            d[x] += (x + i)

        return max(d.values())
```
