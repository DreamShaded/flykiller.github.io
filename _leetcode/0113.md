#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/

#### Solution
This is classical dfs problem: let use `dfs(node, sm)` function, which have parameters:

1. `node` is current node we are in now.
2. `sm` is value we need to get.
3. output are all possible paths we can get, here I keep them inverted, because it is faster to add to the end of list.

When we traverse our tree, we need to do the following:

1. Check if we go outside tree, in this case we return `[]`.
2. Check if we reached leaf, and value in this leaf is equal to `node.val`, in this case return `[[node.val]]`.
3. Run function recursively for left and right children. Not that some of them can be empty, in thic case answer for this child will be `[]`.
4. Finally, return list of lists for both left and right children.

#### Complexity
Complexity of pure dfs part is just `O(n)`, what is more interesting is complexity of this dfs where we need to keep lists. If we consider balanced tree, than we can have `O(n)` solutions, which of which have `O(log n)` length, so time and space complexity will be `O(n log n)`. However it can go upto `O(n^2)`, see the following example:

Let us have tree with `n` nodes, such that first it is single line with length `n/2`:   `a1 -> a2 -> ... a_(n//2) -> (full tree on n/2 nodes)`. All values in all nodes equal to `1`. Then there will be `n//4` leafs and path to each leaf has `n//2+log(n//2) = O(n)` length, so all paths will take `n//4*(n//2 + log(n//2)) = O(n^2)` time and space complexity. See image for more details.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root, sm):
        def dfs(node, sm):
            if not node: return []
            if not node.left and not node.right and sm == node.val:
                return [[node.val]]
           
            lft = dfs(node.left, sm - node.val)
            rgh = dfs(node.right, sm - node.val)
            return [cand + [node.val] for cand in lft + rgh]
            
        return [s[::-1] for s in dfs(root, sm)]
