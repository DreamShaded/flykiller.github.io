#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Adjacent-Swaps-to-Group-Ones/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Adjacent-Swaps-to-Group-Ones/

#### Solution
It is special case of problem Leetcode 1703. Minimum Adjacent Swaps for K Consecutive Ones. The idea is to look at indexes where we have `1`, then we need to answer the question: we need to choose window of size `k` and evaluate value that has minimum distance to their median sequence. In this problem in fact we have only one option to choose window.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        A = [i for i, a in enumerate(A) if a == "1"]
        n = len(A)
        B = [0] + list(accumulate(A))
        return B[n] - B[n//2] - B[(n+1)//2] - B[0] - (n // 2) * ((n + 1) // 2)
```
