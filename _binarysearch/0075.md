#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Making-Change/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Making-Change/

#### Solution
We can use greedy strategy here, starting from big coins.

#### Complexity
It is `O(1)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        x = [25, 10, 5, 1]
        ans = 0
        for coin in x:
            ans += n//coin
            n %= coin
        return ans
```
