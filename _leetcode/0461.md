We are asked to find the number of positions, where `x` and `y` have equal bits. It is the same as finding number of `1` bits in number `t = x^y`. There is efficient way to find number of `1` bits in any number, using `t = t&(t-1)` trick: this operation in fact removes the last `1` bit from `t`. So, we just apply this rule in loop and increment our counter `Out`.

**Complexity** is `O(k)`, where `k` is Hamming distance between numbers `x` and `y`, memory is `O(1)`. Note, that it works (twice?) faster than usual bit counts, which have always `32` iterations.

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingDistance(self, x, y):
        Out, t = 0, x^y 
        while t:
            t, Out = t & (t-1), Out + 1
        return Out
```
