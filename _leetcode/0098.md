We need to check that some property holds for every node of our tree, so as usual any recursion method should work here. Let us use function `dfs(node, low, high)`, where:
1. `node` is node we are currently in
2. `low` and `high` are bounds we expect to value of this node be in.

Now, let us go to the main algorithm:
1. If we have `None` node, we are happy: empty tree is BST
2. Next we check if `low < node.val < high` and if it is not true, we can immedietly return `False`.
3. Finally, we check conditions for left children: its value should be in `(low, node.val)` and for right children: `(node.val, high)`. If one of this `dfs` return False, we need to return False.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)` to traverse every node of our tree. Space complexity is `O(h)`, where `h` is height of our tree.

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root):
        def dfs(node, low, high):
            if not node: return True
            if not low < node.val < high: return False
            return dfs(node.left, low, node.val) and dfs(node.right, node.val, high)
        
        return dfs(root, -float("inf"), float("inf"))
```
