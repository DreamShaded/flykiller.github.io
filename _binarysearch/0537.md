#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Revolving-Door/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Revolving-Door/

#### Solution
You need to code quite a lot in this problem to mark it as easy. Basically what we need to do is carefully simulate process, but we need to deal with some edge cases. Denote by `events` correspondences `time -> [number of in, number of out]`. Then we traverse times in sorted order and:
1. If `t > time`, it means we do not have queue, update time and direction.
2. `x` and `y` are number of persons want to go in and out. Notice, that we start with persons with `direction` first.
3. First let all person with `direction` go in/out and then for all others.
4. Update time. If we have some persons with `direction ^ 1`, change direction.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python

class Solution:
    def solve(self, requests):
        events = defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0])
        for t, d in requests:
            events[t][d] += 1

        ans = []
        direction = 1
        time = 0
        for t in sorted(events):
            if t > time:
                time = t
                direction = 1

            x = events[t][direction]
            y = events[t][direction ^ 1]

            for t in range(time, time + x):
                ans.append([t, direction])
            for t in range(time + x, time + x + y):
                ans.append([t, direction ^ 1])

            time += x + y
            if y:
                direction ^= 1

        return ans
```
