Let us iterate through our data and at each moment of time keep at most `2` candidates with the highest score, let us consider example `1 2 3 3 3 2 2 2 4 2`.

1. On first step we add `1` to our candidates, frequency `1`, so we have `1: 1`
2. Now we add `2` to our candidates, frequency `1`, so we have `1:1, 2:1`.
3. Now we add `3` to our candidates and we have `1:1, 2:1, 3:1`. Now we subtract `1` from all frequencies, because it will not change anything.
4. Now we add `3`, so we have `3:1`.
5. Now we add `3`, so we have `3:2`.
6. Now we add `2`, so we have `3:2, 2:1`.
7. Now we add `2`, so we have `3:2, 2:2`.
8. Now we add `2`, so we have `3:2, 2:3`.
9. Now we add `4`, so we have `3:2, 2:3, 4:1`, subtract `1` from all, and we have `3:1, 2:2`.
10. Finally we add `2`, so we have `3:1, 2:3`.

First stage of our algorithm is finished, we have no more than two candidates. Now we need to make sure, that these candidates indeed has frequence more than `[n/3]`. So we iterate through our data once again and count them. In our case `2` is true candidate and `3` need to be removed, its frequency is not big enough.

**Complexity**: Time complexity is `O(n)`, because we traverse our `nums` twice: on first run we process each number at most twice: when we add it to counter and when remove. Second run, where we evaluate frequencies of candidates is also linear. Space complexity is `O(1)`, because our counter always have no more than `3` elements.

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        count = Counter()
        for num in nums:
            count[num] += 1
            if len(count) == 3:
                new_count = Counter()
                for elem, freq in count.items(): 
                    if freq != 1: new_count[elem] = freq - 1
                count = new_count
                    
        cands = Counter(num for num in nums if num in count)      
        return [num for num in cands if cands[num] > len(nums)/3]
```
