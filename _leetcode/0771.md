#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/

#### Solution
Just check for each element in `S` that it is in `J`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(m + n)`, where `m` is length of `S` and `n` is length of `J`. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
        set_J = set(J)
        return sum(s in set_J for s in S)
```
