#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Squares-in-a-Grid/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Squares-in-a-Grid/

#### Solution
We can notice that every square can be inscribed into some square with sides parallel to `OX` and `OY`. Moreover for square with side `t`, there can be `(r-t)*(c-t)` ways to choose this square and then `t` ways to incribe another square inside. Total answer is 

$$\sum\limits_{t=1}^{\min(r,c)}(r-t)(c-t)t, $$
which can be written in closed form, using sum of squares and sum of cubes formulae.

#### Complexity
It is `O(1)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, r, c):
        x = min(r, c)
        return (x*(x+1)*(c*(6*r-4*x-2) - 2*r*(2*x+1) + 3*x*(x+1))//12) % (10**9 + 7)
```
