#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/coloring-a-border/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/coloring-a-border/

#### Solution
Standard dfs/bfs problem with a bit strange statement: you need to deal carefuly with border of grid. When we have value `(r, c)` with color `clr` and its neighbour `(i, j)` with different color, we know that it is border.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def colorBorder(self, grid, r0, c0, color):
        m, n, clr = len(grid), len(grid[0]), grid[r0][c0]
        queue, V = deque([(r0, c0)]), {(r0, c0)}
        while queue:
            r, c = queue.popleft()
            if r in [0, m - 1] or c in [0, n - 1]:
                grid[r][c] = color
            for i, j in (r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c), (r - 1, c):
                if not 0 <= i < m or not 0 <= j < n or (i, j) in V: continue
                if grid[i][j] == clr:
                    V.add((i, j))
                    queue += [(i, j)]
                else:    
                    grid[r][c] = color
        return grid
```
