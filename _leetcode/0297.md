#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/

#### Solution
We can keep tuple of embedded tuples: if we have `None` we return "#". Then for every node we return tuple with `3` elements: `(node, left child, right child)`. To deserialize we look at `data[0]` and connect `data[1]` as the left children and `data[2]` as the right children.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` to serialize and deserialize, even though constant can be around `5`.

#### Code
```python
class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        if not root: return "#"
        return root.val, self.serialize(root.left), self.serialize(root.right)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        if data[0] == "#": return None
        node = TreeNode(data[0])
        node.left = self.deserialize(data[1])
        node.right = self.deserialize(data[2])
        return node
```

#### Remrak
There are a lot of different ideas how we can solve this problem:
1. We can use problem **0105**, where we create two traversals: preorder and inorder and reconstruct tree with them.
2. We can use and dfs traversal: preorder, inorder or postorder with dummy variables `#` for None nodes.
