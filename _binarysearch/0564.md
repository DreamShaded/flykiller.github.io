#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Making-Pairwise-Adjacent-Sums-Small/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Making-Pairwise-Adjacent-Sums-Small/

#### Solution
The idea is to start from the left and use greedy strategy. First of all, for pair `[0, 1]` we have choice: decrease `0` or `1` and it is always better to decrease `1`. Then on the next step for pair `[1, 2]` if it is already `<= k` we do nothing, if it is `> k`, then we decrease `2`-th element and so on.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        ans, M = 0, 10 ** 9 + 7
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            steps = nums[i] + nums[i - 1] - k
            if steps > 0:
                ans += steps
                nums[i] = max(0, nums[i] - steps)
        return ans % M
```
