#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/elimination-game/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/elimination-game/

#### Solution
Note, that at each iteration we have arithmetic progression. Let us keep only `4` numbers on each iteration `begin, step, end, direction`, where `direction` is either `0` or `1` for left to right and from right to left movement correspondingly. We can update these for number in `O(1)`, for example for `direction = 0: (a, step, b, 0) -> (a+step, 2*step, b-(b-a-step)%(2*step), 1)`, similar for another direction. We always keep `begin <= end`. Here `(b - a - step) % (2*step)` is equal to `0` or `step` and used to calculate if we need to take the last element or not depending of parity.

#### Complexity
So, overall complexity will be `O(log n)`, because we need to do at most `log n` iterations. It can be done in recursive way with oneliner as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lastRemaining(self, n):
        def one_step(a, step, b, ind):
            if ind == 0:
                return (a + step, 2*step, b - (b-a-step) % (2*step), 1)
            if ind == 1:
                return (a + (b-a-step) % (2*step), 2*step, b-step, 0)
        
        a, step, b, ind = 1, 1, n, 0
        while a != b:
            a, step, b, ind = one_step(a, step, b, ind)            
        return a       
```
