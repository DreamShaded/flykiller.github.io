#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/

#### Solution
Not difficult, but technical problem. Let us keep `buffer`: list of words to fill the last line so far and `curr_len` is how much space it will take if we use only one space between words.

Iterate through `words` and check if we can add word to `buffer`: if we can, add it, if not, it means that we need to build string. Calculate number of empty spaces `empty` and number of gaps `places`. If `places == 0`, we need to use only one word in string. If it is more than zero, find `a, b = divmod(empty, places)` and then for each word add `a` spaces after word and also for first `b` words add one extra space. In the end concatenate everything and add to `ans`. Finally add last not-full string.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is just `O(n)`, where `n` is total length of `words`: we traverse every word once. Also it can be shown, that final answer will consist no more than `3n` to `4n` symbols (cases something like `words = [a, a, aaaaaaaaaa, aaaaaaaaaa], maxWidth = 20`, so all adding of spaces will not break complexity. Space complexity is `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def fullJustify(self, words, maxWidth):
        buffer, curr_len = [words[0]], len(words[0])
        ans = []
        for i, word in enumerate(words[1:]):
            if curr_len + len(word) + 1 <= maxWidth:
                buffer.append(word)
                curr_len += len(word) + 1
            else:
                empty = maxWidth - curr_len + len(buffer) - 1
                places = len(buffer) - 1
                if places == 0: 
                    ans.append(buffer[0] + " "*(maxWidth - len(buffer[0])))
                else:
                    a, b = divmod(empty, places)
                    for i in range(places): buffer[i] += " "*a
                    for i in range(b): buffer[i] += " "
                    ans.append("".join(buffer))
                buffer, curr_len = [word], len(word)
        
        t = " ".join(buffer)
        return ans + [t + " "*(maxWidth - len(t))]
```
