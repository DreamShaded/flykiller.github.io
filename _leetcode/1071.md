tags: [string, math]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/

#### Solution
First, we check if `s1 + s2 == s2 + s1`, in this case we know that `gcd` is not empty. If it is not empty, it is equal to gcd of lengths.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def gcdOfStrings(self, s1, s2):
        return s1[:gcd(len(s1), len(s2))] if s1 + s2 == s2 + s1 else ""
```
