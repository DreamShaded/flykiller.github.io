#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Maximum-of-the-Smallest-Chunk/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Maximum-of-the-Smallest-Chunk/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1231 Divide Chocolate, but change `K + 1` to `K`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*log(Q))`, where `Q = sum(nums)//(K+1) + 1`. Space complexit is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, K):
        def check(Q):
            acc, ans = 0, 0
            for num in nums + [0]:
                if acc < Q:
                    acc += num
                else:
                    acc = num
                    ans += 1
            return ans >= K

        beg, end = 1, sum(nums)//K + 1
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if not check(mid):
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid
        
        return beg
```
