#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/fraction-addition-and-subtraction/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/fraction-addition-and-subtraction/

#### Solution
Split string into fractions, we can do it using regular expressions for example. Then split every fraction and put into `s` pairs of numerator/denominator. Then use function `AddFrac` and traverse our list, adding fractions one by one.

#### Complexity
Space complexity is `O(n)`, time complexity is `O(n log x)`, where `x` is the biggest possible value of denominator, because we use `gcd` function. We can also first sum all fraction and then use gcd only once but for bigger numbers.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def fractionAddition(self, expression):
        def AddFrac(a,b,c,d):
            m, n = a*d+b*c, b*d
            Q = math.gcd(m,n)
            return [m//Q, n//Q]
        
        if expression[0] != "-" : expression = "+" + expression
        fractions = re.split("[+-]+", expression)[1:]
        signs = [int(s=="+")*2-1 for s in expression if s in "+-"]
        n = len(signs)
        
        s = []
        for i in range(n):
            a, b = fractions[i].split("/")
            s.append([int(a)*signs[i], int(b)])
            
        while len(s) > 1:
            a, b = s.pop()
            c, d = s.pop()
            s.append(AddFrac(a,b,c,d))
            
        return str(s[0][0]) + "/" + str(s[0][1])
```
