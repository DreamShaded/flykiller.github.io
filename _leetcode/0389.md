title: Leetcode 0389 Find the Difference
tags: [string, hash table, counter, bit manipulation]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/

#### Solution
One solution is just to use counters and then find the difference, time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `(26)` number of letters.

#### Complexity

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        return list((Counter(t) - Counter(s)).keys())[0]
```

#### Remark
There is another `O(1)` space solution, using bit manipulations: just evaluate bit-wise xor for all symbols in two words and you answer will be exactly symbol we are looking for.
