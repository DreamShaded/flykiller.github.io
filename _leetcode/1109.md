#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/corporate-flight-bookings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/corporate-flight-bookings/

#### Solution
Let us keep differences of array, we can update them in `O(1)` and evaluate cumulative sum in the end.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def corpFlightBookings(self, B, n):
        diff = [0]*(n + 1)
        for x, y, s in B:
            diff[x-1] += s
            diff[y] -= s
        return list(accumulate(diff))[:-1]
```
