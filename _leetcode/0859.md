title: Leetcode 0859. Buddy Strings
tags: []
---

Let us carefully cover all possible cases in this problem:
1. If lengths of strings are different, we immedietly return `False`.
2. If counters of strings are different, we also return `False`.
3. Let us also evaluate for each place if symbols in `A` and `B` are equal. We can afford to have only `2` symbols which are not equal or `0`: in first case we change two different symbols and in second two equal. So, if number of not equal symbols is not `0` or `2`, we return `False`.
4. Also, if we have number `diff_places == 0`, it means that we changed two equal symbols. We can not do it if all string has different symbols, like `abtlpe`, so we return `False` in this case.
5. If we have `diff_places == 2`, it means that we changed two different symbols. We can not do it if string is just one symbols repeated, like `ddddddd`, so we return `False` in this case.
6. Finally, if we did not return anything yet, we return `True`.

**Complexity** is `O(n)`, because we use counters, which is linear and number of not equal symbols which is linear as well.

```python
class Solution:
    def buddyStrings(self, A, B):
        if len(A) != len(B): return False
        Count_A, Count_B = Counter(A), Counter(B)
        if Count_A != Count_B: return False
        diff_places = sum([i!=j for i,j in zip(A,B)])
        if diff_places not in [0, 2]: return False
        if diff_places == 0 and len(Count_A) == len(A): return False
        if diff_places == 2 and len(Count_A) == 1: return False
        return True
```
