tags: [string, two pointers]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-ii/

#### Solution
Just special case of problem **0151**: what we need to do here is to reverse each word, using two pointers technique and then reverse whole string.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$, space complexity is $O(1)$, because we do everything in place.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        def reverse(i, j):
            while i < j:
                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
                i, j = i + 1, j - 1
        
        beg, end = 0, 0
        while end < len(s):
            if s[end] == " ":
                reverse(beg, end - 1)
                beg, end = end + 1, end + 1
            else:
                end += 1
                
        reverse(beg, end - 1)
        reverse(0, len(s) - 1)
```
