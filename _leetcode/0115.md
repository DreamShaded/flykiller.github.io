title: Leetcode 0115. Distinct Subsequences
tags: [string, dp]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/

#### Solution
Dynamic programming problem, where `dp[i][j]` is the number of subsequences of `S[0:i]`, equal to `T[0:j]`. Then to evaluate `dp(i, j)` we need to look at two options:
1. `dp(i - 1, j)`: if we do not include the symbol `s[i]`.
2. `dp(i - 1, j - 1)` if we include it but it is only for the case when `s[i] == t[j]`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)`, space complexity as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s, t):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == -1: return j == -1
            if j == -1: return j == -1
            return dp(i-1, j) + (s[i] == t[j]) * dp(i-1, j-1)
            
        return dp(len(s) - 1, len(t) - 1)
```
