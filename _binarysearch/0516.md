#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Bit-Sum/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Bit-Sum/

#### Solution
For each digit place, evaluate how many zeroes we have in this place. Then do the second pass, where we start with the smallest places first.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n * M)`, where `M = 32` here (or can be taken as maximum number of bits for number in array).

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        cnt, MOD = [0] * 32, 10**9 + 7
        for num in nums:
            for j in range(32):
                cnt[j] += 1 - (num >> j & 1)

        ans = sum(nums)
        for i in range(32):
            n = min(cnt[i], k)
            ans += n * (1 << i)
            k -= n

        return ans % MOD
```
