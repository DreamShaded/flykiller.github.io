The simplest way to solve this problem is use backtracking, where you just generate all sequences, with complexity `O(k) = O(n!)`. We can do better. Let us consider an example: `n=6`, `k=314`. How we can find the first digit? There are `5! = 120` permutations, which start with `1`, there are also `120` permutations, which start with `2`, and so on. `314 > 2*120` and `314 < 3*120`, so it means, that the fist digit we need to take is `3`. So we build first digit of our number, remove it from list of all digits `digits` and continue:

1. `k = 314-2*5! = 74`, `n - 1 = 5`, `d = 3`, build number so far `3`, `digits = [1,2,4,5,6]`
2. `k = 74-3*4! = 2`, `n - 1 = 4`, `d = 0`, build number so far `35`, `digits = [1,2,4,6]`
3. `k = 2-0*3! = 2`, `n - 1 = 3`, `d = 0`, build number so far `351`, `digits = [2,4,6]`
4. `k = 2-1*2! = 0`, `n - 1 = 2`, `d = 2`, build number so far `3512`, `digits = [4,6]`
5. `k = 0-1*1! = 0`, `n - 1 = 1`, `d = 2`, build number so far `35126`, `digits = [4]`
6. Finally, we have only one digit left, output is `351264`.

**Complexity**. I keep list of `n` digits, and then delete them one by one. Complexity of one deletion is `O(n)`, so overall complexity is `O(n^2)`. Note, that it can be improved to `O(n log n)` if we use SortedList, but it just not worth it, `n` is too small.

```python
class Solution:
    def getPermutation(self, n, k):
        numbers = list(range(1,n+1))
        answer = ""
        
        for n_it in range(n,0,-1):
            d = (k-1)//factorial(n_it-1)
            k -= d*factorial(n_it-1)
            answer += str(numbers[d])
            numbers.remove(numbers[d])
                   
        return answer
```

### Oneliner
Here it is, with `O(n^2)` complexity!

```
return reduce(lambda s,n:(s[0]+s[2][(d:=s[1]//(f:=factorial(n)))],s[1]%f,s[2][:d]+s[2][d+1:]),range(n-1,-1,-1),('',k-1,'123456789'))[0]
```
