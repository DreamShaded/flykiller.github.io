#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Contiguously-Strictly-Increasing-Sublist-After-Deletion/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Contiguously-Strictly-Increasing-Sublist-After-Deletion/

#### Solution
Let `dp0[i]` is be the answer for `s[:i+1]`, where we do not delete any elements and `dp1[i]`, where we delete one element. Then we can update values for `i` if we know for `i - 1`. Notice, that `dp1[0] = 0`, because when we delete one element, there will be `0` elements.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space. Space can be made `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        if not nums: return 0
        n = len(nums)
        dp0 = [1]*n
        dp1 = [0] + [1]*(n-1)

        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
                dp0[i] = 1 + dp0[i - 1]
                dp1[i] = 1 + dp1[i - 1]
            if i > 1 and nums[i] > nums[i - 2]:
                dp1[i] = max(dp1[i], dp0[i-2] + 1)

        return max(max(dp0), max(dp1))
```
