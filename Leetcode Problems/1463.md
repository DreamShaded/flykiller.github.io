title: Leetcode 1463. Cherry Pickup II
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1463/
---

The idea here is to use dynamic programming with 3 states: `dp[j][i1][i2]`, where `j` is the number of row and, `i1` is the number of column for the first robot and `i2` is the number of column for the second robot. I also added dummy columns filled with big negative numbers to handle with border cases.

First, we need to fill `dp[0][1][M]` value of our table, which corresponds to column `0` for the first robot and column `M-1` for the second robot. Then we just go through the table and check all possible `3 x 3 = 9` cases for previous state of our robots, find maximum and update. We also need to deal with case, when they are at the same cell, which can be done with `(grid[j][i1-1] + grid[j][i2-1])//(1 + (i1 == i2))` code. In the end we need to return maximum over possile `M*M` values in the last row, that is for `dp[-1]`

### Complexity 
We have `O(9*M*M*N)` time complexity, where `M` is number of columns and `N` is number of rows, because we potentially need to check upto 9 candidates. Time complexity is `O(M*M*N)` to keep `dp` table.

class Solution:
    def cherryPickup(self, grid):
        M, N = len(grid[0]), len(grid)

        dp = [[[-10**9] * (M+2) for _ in range(M+2)] for _ in range(N)]
        dp[0][1][M] = grid[0][0] + grid[0][M-1]
        for j in range(1, N):
            for i1, i2 in product(range(1, M+1), range(1, M+1)):
                cand_prev = []
                for shift1, shift2 in product([-1,0,1], [-1,0,1]):
                    cand_prev.append(dp[j-1][i1 + shift1][i2 + shift2])
                    dp[j][i1][i2] = (grid[j][i1-1] + grid[j][i2-1])//(1 + (i1 == i2)) + max(cand_prev)

        return max(list(map(max, *dp[-1])))
