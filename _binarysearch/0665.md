#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Recover-Order-on-Queue-of-People/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Recover-Order-on-Queue-of-People/

#### Solution 1
Equal to Leetcode 0406. Queue Reconstruction by Height.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, people):
        people = [[x,y,y] for x, y in people]
        
        out = []
        while people:
            ind = people.index(min(people,key=lambda x: (x[2],x[0])))
            out.append(people.pop(ind))
            people = [[x,y,z - (x <= out[-1][0])] for x,y,z in people ]
    
        return [[x,y] for x,y,z in out]
```

#### Solution 2
There is better `O(n log n)` solution as well! The idea is to use sorted list in python to simulate our process.	

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, Q):
        l = len(Q)
        order = [None] * l

        SList = SortedList(range(l))
        for h, c in sorted(Q, key = lambda x: (x[0], -x[1])):
            order[SList[c]] = (h, c)
            SList.pop(c)

        return order
```
