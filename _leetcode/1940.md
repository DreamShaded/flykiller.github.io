tags: [hash table, sort, counter]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence-between-sorted-arrays/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence-between-sorted-arrays/

#### Solution
Actually what is asked is to find intersection of several given sets, because number in our arrays are increasing. So, we just find intersection and then sort our data.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(N + x*log x)`, where `X` is total length of all sequences and `x` is the lengt of answer (which is not bigger than `min(len(A[i])`)

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, A):
        start = set(A[0])
        for seq in A[1:]:
            start &= set(seq)
        return sorted(start)
```

#### Remark
Or we can just count numbers and take only those who have frequency `len(A)`.
