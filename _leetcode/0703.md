#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/

#### Solution
Similar to Problems **0973** K Closest Points to Origin and **0215** Kth Largest Element in an Array with exactly the same idea: here we heap min-heap with `k` biggest elements, then `k`-th largest element will be in the root of our heap. When we have new element we check if it is more than root of our heap, then we put this element to heap and remove smallest element from heap, so we will always keep it `k` elements.

#### Complexity
It is `O(k + (n-k)*log k)` for `init` and `O(log k)` for `add`. Space complexity is `O(k)`.

#### Code
```python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k, nums):
        self.heap = nums[:k]
        heapify(self.heap)
        self.k = k
        for num in nums[k:]:
            if num > self.heap[0]:
                heappushpop(self.heap, num)
                
    def add(self, val) :
        if len(self.heap) < self.k:
            heappush(self.heap, val)
        elif val > self.heap[0]:
            heappushpop(self.heap, val)
            
        return self.heap[0]
```
