#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/0-1-Knapsack/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/0-1-Knapsack/

#### Solution
Classical knapsack problem, which can be solved with `dp`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(nm)` for time and `O(m)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, wt, val, m):
        dp = [0] * (m + 1)
        for i in range(1, len(wt) + 1):
            cp = dp[:]
            q, t = wt[i - 1], val[i - 1]
            for w in range(wt[i - 1], m + 1):
                dp[w] = max(dp[w], cp[w - q] + t)
        return dp[-1]
```
