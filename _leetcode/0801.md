title: Leetcode 0801 Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing
tags: [dp, array]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-make-sequences-increasing/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-make-sequences-increasing/

#### Solution
Let `dp1[k]` be answer for first $k$ indexes, if we do not swap last pair and `dp2[k]` the same if we swap last pair. Then:

1. `if A[i] < A[i+1]` and `B[i] < B[i+1]` it means, that we have `dp[i]` option for `dp[i+1]` and`dp2[i] + 1` option for `dp2[i+1]` we need to make one more swap here.
2. `if B[i] < A[i+1]` and `A[i] < B[i+1]` (this is not exclusive option, both can happen!), then we have `dp2[i]` option for `dp1[i+1]` and`dp1[i] + 1` option for `dp2[i+1]`, here we need to add one more swap here.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space as well. Space can be reduced to `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minSwap(self, A, B):
        n = len(A)
        dp1 = [0] + [float("inf")]*(n-1)
        dp2 = [1] + [float("inf")]*(n-1)

        for i in range(n-1):
            if A[i] < A[i+1] and B[i] < B[i+1]: 
                dp1[i+1] = min(dp1[i+1], dp1[i])
                dp2[i+1] = min(dp2[i+1], dp2[i] + 1)
            if B[i] < A[i+1] and A[i] < B[i+1]:
                dp1[i+1] = min(dp1[i+1], dp2[i])
                dp2[i+1] = min(dp2[i+1], dp1[i] + 1)
                
        return min(dp1[-1], dp2[-1])
```
