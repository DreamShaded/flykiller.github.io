#### Problem statement

#### Solution
Let us reverse our problem: start with `t` and then we can take symbol from any place and put it to the start or to the end. After several such operation we will have `prefix + midfix + suffix`. Notice that elements in `midfix` will have the same order as in original array. Also we need to minimize sum of length of prefix and suffix, which is equivalent to maximizing the length of `midfix`. So, finally, what we need to find is the longest substring of `t`, which is subsequence of `s`.  It is very similar to classical LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) problem, but do not look at `dp(i	- 1, j)` here.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, t):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            return max(dp(i, j-1), (1 + dp(i-1, j-1)) * (s[i-1] == t[j-1])) if i*j else 0
        
        n, m = len(s), len(t)
        return n - max(dp(i, j) for i, j in product(range(n+1), range(m+1)))
```
