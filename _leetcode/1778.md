title: Leetcode 1778 Shortest Path in a Hidden Grid
tags: [dfs, bfs, interactive, graph]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-hidden-grid/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-hidden-grid/

#### Solution
In this problem we need to find the shortest distance, however we can not use `bfs`, because we can not move at several cells in the same time. So the only choice we have is the following:

1. Perform `dfs` and save traversed graph.
2. Run `bfs` on saved graph and find the shortest distance.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)` as well as space complexity.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findShortestPath(self, master):
        dirs = [("U", -1, 0), ("D", 1, 0), ("L", 0, -1), ("R", 0, 1)]
        back = {"U": "D", "D": "U", "L": "R", "R": "L"}
        
        G = {(0, 0): master.isTarget()}
        
        def dfs(x, y):
            for d, dx, dy in dirs:
                x1, y1 = x + dx, y + dy
                if (x1, y1) not in G and master.canMove(d):
                    master.move(d)
                    G[x1, y1] = master.isTarget()
                    dfs(x1, y1)
                    master.move(back[d])
                    
        dfs(0, 0)
        
        queue = deque([(0, 0, 0)])
        visited = set()
        
        while queue:
            dist, x, y = queue.popleft()
            if G[x, y]: return dist
            
            for dx, dy in (x+1, y), (x, y+1), (x-1, y), (x, y-1):
                if (dx, dy) not in G or (dx, dy) in visited: continue
                visited.add((dx, dy))
                queue.append((dist + 1, dx, dy))
                
        return -1
```
