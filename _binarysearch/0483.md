<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Skip-Tasks-to-Minimize-Work/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Skip-Tasks-to-Minimize-Work/

#### Solution
Variation of Leetcode 0198. House Robber, but return `sum(nums) - dp2`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        dp1, dp2 = 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            dp1, dp2 = dp2, max(dp1 + num, dp2)          
        return sum(nums) - dp2 
```
