#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Kth-Smallest-in-a-Binary-Search-Tree/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Kth-Smallest-in-a-Binary-Search-Tree/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

#### Complexity
It is `O(k)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, root, k):
        stack, curr = [], root
        
        while stack or curr:
            while curr:
                stack.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
            curr = stack.pop()
            
            if k == 0:
                return curr.val
            
            k -= 1
            curr = curr.right
```
