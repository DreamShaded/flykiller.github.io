title: Leetcode 1772 Sort Features by Popularity
tags: [string, hash table, sort]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-features-by-popularity/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-features-by-popularity/

#### Solution
All we need to do is go through responses and collect all words, then sort then by frequencies.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(M + N*log N)`, where `M` is total length of `responses` and `M` is total length of `F`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sortFeatures(self, F, responses):
        cnt = Counter()
        for resp in responses:
            for word in set(resp.split()):
                cnt[word] += 1
                
        cands = sorted([(-cnt[f], i) for i, f in enumerate(F)])
        return [F[i] for _,i in cands]
```
