#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/toeplitz-matrix/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/toeplitz-matrix/

#### Solution
Just iterate line by line and check that next line elements starting from first equal to current line elements except last one.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)`, space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isToeplitzMatrix(self, matrix):
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        row = matrix[0]
        for i in range(1, m):
            if matrix[i][1:] != row[:-1]: return False
            row = matrix[i]
        return True
```

#### Remark
We also can do it in `O(1)` space if we check for each element its top left neighbor.
