#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Coincidence-Search/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Coincidence-Search/

#### Solution
Just simulate process.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(1)` for additional space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        ans = 0
        for n in nums:
            beg, end = 0, len(nums) - 1

            while beg <= end:
                mid = (beg + end) // 2
                if nums[mid] < n:
                    beg = mid + 1
                elif nums[mid] > n:
                    end = mid - 1
                else:
                    ans += 1
                    break
        return ans
```
