#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Group-Integers/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Group-Integers/

#### Solution
Just check that gcd of all frequencies is not equal to `1`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        freqs = list(Counter(nums).values())
        return reduce(gcd, freqs, 0) != 1
```
