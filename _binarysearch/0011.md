#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Univalue-Tree-Count/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Univalue-Tree-Count/

#### Solution
Use dfs with state `(if subtree is good, value of this subtree)`. Second value can be anything if subtree is not good.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(h)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, root):
        self.ans = 0
        def dfs(node):
            x, vals = [True], [node.val]
            for child in filter(None, [node.left, node.right]):
                ans1, val1 = dfs(child)
                vals += [val1]
                x += [ans1]

            if False not in x and len(set(vals)) == 1:
                self.ans += 1
                return [True, vals[0]]
            else:
                return [False, 0]

        dfs(root)
        return self.ans
```
