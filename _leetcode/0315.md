#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/

#### Solution
Start from the last number and keep numbers in BST (in python it is `SortedList`). Then when we see new number we need to find how many elements in this list smaller than this number, and then put this number into our sorted list.

#### Complexity
Complexity of both operations : add to list and do binary search with `bisect_left` is `O(log n)`, so overall complexity is `O(n log n)`.

#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class Solution:
    def countSmaller(self, nums):
        SList, ans = SortedList(), []
        for num in nums[::-1]:
            ind = SortedList.bisect_left(SList, num)
            ans.append(ind)
            SList.add(num)
            
        return ans[::-1]
```

#### Remark
In this type of problems there is often solutions using segment tree or BIT: the idea is to for each number get its order statistics, that is what will be the place if we sort. For example, if we have `3,1,4,5,2`, then we create `[0,0,0,0,0]` array, then we meet number `3` first, so we update it like `[0,0,1,0,0]`, then we have `[1,0,1,0,0]`, then we have `[1,0,1,1,0], [1,0,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1]`. Instead of keeping list, what we keep is Segment Tree or BIT for quick answers for ranges: actually what we want to evaluate on each step is sum of elements in some range `[0, ind]`. Complexity of these approaches will be `O(n log n)` as well.
