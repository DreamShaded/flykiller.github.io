#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-with-swaps/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-with-swaps/

#### Solution
We just need to find connected components: we can do it either with dfs or with union find. Also we need to return the lexicographically smallest string, so we need to sort values inside each connected component.

#### Complexity
for this dfs solution complexity is `O(n log n + E)`, where `n` is length of `s` and `E` is number of connections.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestStringWithSwaps(self, s, pairs):
        visited, ans, graph = set(), {}, defaultdict(list)
        comps, ind, n = defaultdict(list), 0, len(s)
        for x, y in pairs:
            graph[x].append(y)
            graph[y].append(x)
        
        def dfs(node, i):
            visited.add(node)
            comps[i].append(node)
            for neib in graph[node]:
                if neib in visited: continue
                dfs(neib, i)
                
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in visited:
                dfs(i, ind)
                ind += 1
                
        for comp in comps.values():
            for i, l in zip(sorted(comp), sorted(s[t] for t in comp)):
                ans[i] = l
            
        return "".join(ans[i] for i in range(n))
```
