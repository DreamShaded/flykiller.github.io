#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-quad-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-quad-tree/

#### Solution
Basically do, what is asked to do: on each step check if all elements are equal, and if not, run recursion. Time complexity of this approach is `O(n^2 log n)`, because equation is $T(n) = 4\cdot T(n/2) + O(n^2)$.

We can also do it in `O(n^2)` time if we use helper dfs function: to evaluate if for some sub-array all elements are equal we need to check if they are equal for `4` parts and also check that they are equal to each other. I use `dfs(x1, y1, x2, y2)` function, and return leaf if `x2 = x1 + 1`. Then recursively call function `4` times and if we have all `4` children which are leafs and they have equal value, we return `Node(val, 1, None, None, None, None)`, so we can say we delete links to previous leafs. If not all children are leafs or they have different values, return `Node(1, 0, N1, N2, N3, N4)`, where `N1, N2, N3, N4` are recursively called function for 4 sub-arrays.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2)`, space is `O(n^2)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def construct(self, grid):
        def dfs(x1, y1, x2, y2):
            if x2 - x1 == 1: 
                return Node(grid[x1][y1], 1, None, None, None, None)

            xm, ym = (x1+x2)//2, (y1+y2)//2

            N1 = dfs(x1, y1, xm, ym)
            N2 = dfs(x1, ym, xm, y2)
            N3 = dfs(xm, y1, x2, ym)
            N4 = dfs(xm, ym, x2, y2)

            isLeafNew = N1.isLeaf and N2.isLeaf and N3.isLeaf and N4.isLeaf
            isEqual = N1.val==N2.val and N2.val==N3.val and N3.val == N4.val

            if isLeafNew and isEqual:
                return Node(N1.val, 1, None, None, None, None)
            else:
                return Node(1, 0, N1, N2, N3, N4)
        
        return dfs(0, 0, len(grid), len(grid))
```
