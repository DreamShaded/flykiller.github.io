Imagine that we have 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5. Then it can be showed that we need to look at the highest frequency, that is frequency 4 here and look at numbers with this frequency, that is 3, 4, 5. We need to put them on both ends with any permutation. We can continue this process. Time complexity is O(m), where m is the maximum frequency.



MOD, M = 10**9 + 7, 10**6 + 2
F = [1]*(M+1)
for i in range(1, M+1):
    F[i] = (F[i-1] * i) % MOD

m = int(input())
c = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

ans, cnt, m_freq, L = 1, 0, max(c), sum(c)
f = [0]*(m_freq + 1)

for i in c:
    f[i] += 1

while m_freq > 1:
    if f[m_freq] != 0: 
        ans = (ans * F[f[m_freq]]**2) % MOD
        f[m_freq - 2] += f[m_freq]
        cnt = (cnt + (m_freq - 1)*(L - f[m_freq])*(f[m_freq])) % MOD
        L -= 2*f[m_freq]
    m_freq -= 1

print(str(cnt) + " " + str((ans * F[f[1]]) % MOD))
