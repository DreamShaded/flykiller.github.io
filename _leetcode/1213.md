tags: [array, hash table, sort, counter]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/last-substring-in-lexicographical-order/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/last-substring-in-lexicographical-order/

#### Solution
We can just put all arrays to sets and find intersection and then sort answer.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n + m log m)`, where `n` is total number of elements and `m` is number of elements in the smallest array. 

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def arraysIntersection(self, A1, A2, A3):
        return sorted(set(A1) & set(A2) & set(A3))
```

#### Remark
Or we can use counters to calculate number of times each element is taken and take only those which have frequency `3`: time complexity will be `O(n)`.
