#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-common-region/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-common-region/

#### Solution
In this problem we just need to find LCA of two nodes in graph and only for one pair. So, what we can do is just create parent links and first traverse from `r1` to root and save in in `path`. Then we start with `r2` and see when we have LCA.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space potentially `O(n)` as well.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findSmallestRegion(self, R, r1, r2):
        G, path = defaultdict(list), {r1}
        for r in R:
            for i in r[1:]:
                G[i] = r[0]
                
        while r1 in G:
            r1 = G[r1]
            path.add(r1)
            
        while r2 not in path:
            r2 = G[r2]
            
        return r2
```
