#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/map-sum-pairs/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/map-sum-pairs/

#### Solution
When you see word `prefix` in problem formulation, you should definitely think about **trie**. What we need here is classical trie with one additional field: `freq` - frequency of each node. For example when we add word `apple` with `val = 3` we need to add this `3` to all `a, p, p, l, e` nodes. Also we need to deal with this phrase: ` If the key already existed, the original key-value pair will be overridden to the new one`, so we need to keep dictionary of pairs `key - value` to underastand if they already exist in our tree. Then we evaluate `delta = val - self.dic.get(key, 0)` is amount we need to change our values.  For `sum` function we find node in our tree and if it is not there, return `0`, if we can reach it, return frequency of this node.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(m)` to insert `key` of length `m` as well it is `O(m)` to evaluate `sum` for prefix of length `m`. Space complexity is `O(T)` where `T` it total length of all words.  

#### Code
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.freq = 0

class MapSum:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
        self.dic = {}
        
    def insert(self, key, val):
        delta = val - self.dic.get(key, 0)
        self.dic[key] = val
        node = self.root
        node.freq += delta
        for symbol in key:
            node = node.children.setdefault(symbol, TrieNode())
            node.freq += delta
        
    def sum(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for symbol in prefix:
            if symbol not in node.children:
                return 0
            node = node.children[symbol]
        return node.freq
```

#### Remark
Note, that there is bruteforce solution, where you generate all prefixes and put them into hash table with complexity `O(K^2)` for each insertion, but which works even faster than trie solution: the reason is that operation with strings: espacially comparison is **VERY** fast in python, it has speed similar with C/C++ languages: you can try to generate say string `aaa.... aaab` of length `1000` and compare all substrings of length `500`. You will be suprised with resut.
