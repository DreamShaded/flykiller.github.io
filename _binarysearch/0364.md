---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Unique-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Unique-String/

#### Solution
Calculate counter, then choose the smallest `m - k` frequencies and flip them.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, k):
        c = sorted(list(Counter(s).values()))
        return sum(c) - sum(c[-k:])
```
