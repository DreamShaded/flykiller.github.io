To solve this problem we need to understand the speeds of Hands of a clock.

1. Let us find the place, where **hour hand** is. First, whe have `12` hours in total, for `360` degrees, that means `30` degrees per hour. Also, for every `60` minutes, our hour hand rotated by `1` hour, that is `30` degrees, so for every minute, it is rotated by `0.5` degrees. So, final place for hour hand is `30*hour + 0.5*minutes`
2. Let us find the place, where **minute hand** is: every `60` minutes minute hand makes full rotation, that means we have `6` degrees for each minute.
3. Finally, we evaluate absolute difference between these two numbers, and if angle is more than `180` degrees, we return complementary angle.

**Complexity**: time and space is `O(1)`, we just use some mathematical formulae.

```python
class Solution:
    def angleClock(self, hour, minutes):
        H_place = 30*hour + 0.5*minutes
        M_place = 6*minutes
        diff = abs(H_place - M_place)
        return diff if diff <= 180 else 360 - diff
```

**Oneliner**
We can write this as oneliner as well:
```
return min(abs(30*hour-5.5*minutes),360-abs(30*hour-5.5*minutes))
```
