#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-way-to-form-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-way-to-form-string/

#### Solution
There are different time complexity algorithms, starting with `O(mn)` greedy and `O(n log m)` binary search.

The best algorithm is for every letter and index evaluate places of next occurences of this letter. Then we traverse our string `T` and on each step we do `idx = d[ch][idx]`, it means that we look for index of element `ch` in `S`, starting from place `idx`.

1. Check if `idx >= len(S)`, if it is the case, it means that we reached the end of `S`, so we need to start from the beginning.
2. Update `idx = d[ch][idx]`.
3. `if idx < 0`, it means, that we did not found symbol `ch` in the rest of our string, so we need to start new traversal and we indicate that we reached place `d[ch][0]` already.
4. Increment `idx` by one.

#### Complexity
It is `O(Q*n)`, where `Q` is the size of alphabet, that is `O(26n)` in our case to create `d`. Also we have `m` steps to traverse `T`. So, final time complexity is `O(Q*n + m)`, where `n` is length of `S` and `m` is length of `T`. Space complexity is `O(Q*n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestWay(self, S, T):
        def letter_get(letter, dr):
            n = len(S)
            res, cur = [0]*n, -n
            for i in range(n)[::dr]:
                if S[i] == letter: cur = i
                res[i] = cur
            return res

        S_set, T_set = set(S), set(T)
        if not T_set.issubset(S_set): return -1

        d = defaultdict(list)
        for symb in S:
            d[symb] = letter_get(symb, -1)

        idx, count = 0, 1
        for ch in T:
            if idx == len(S):
                count, idx = count + 1, 0
            idx = d[ch][idx]
            if idx < 0:
                count, idx = count + 1, d[ch][0]
            idx += 1
        return count
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(mn)` solution with two pointers dp and `O(n log m)` with binary search.
