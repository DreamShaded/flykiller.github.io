#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Interleaved-String/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Interleaved-String/

#### Solution
All we need to to use two pointers here and merge strings.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n + m)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s0, s1):
        ans, i = [], 0
        while i < len(s0) and i < len(s1):
            ans += [s0[i], s1[i]]
            i += 1

        ans += s0[i:]
        ans += s1[i:]
        return "".join(ans)
```
