title: Leetcode 0870. Advantage Shuffle
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0870/
---

The idea here is to sort `A` and `B` lists first and start with the biggest number from `B` and check if we can beat it with biggest number from `A`. If we can, do it and increase `beg` pointer. If no, than we need to choose the smallest number we have and we move `end` pointer. One difficulty here is that we need to keep order of data somehow, so we add indexes to `B` list. Then we create `ans` list and change corresponding element of it.

Time complexity is `O(n log n)` to perform sorts and space complexity is `O(n)`.

```
class Solution:
    def advantageCount(self, A, B):
        n = len(A)
        B = sorted([(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(B)])[::-1]
        A = sorted(A)[::-1]
        ans = [-1]*n
        
        beg, end = 0, n - 1
        
        for num, ind in B:
            if A[beg] > num:
                ans[ind] = A[beg]
                beg += 1
            else:
                ans[ind] = A[end]
                end -= 1
                
        return ans
```
