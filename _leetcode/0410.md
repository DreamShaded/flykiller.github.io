#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/

#### Solution 1
One way is to use binary search for `Q`: check if we can split numbers into `m` groups such that the largest sum $\leqslant Q$. We do it in greedy way.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of this approach is `O(n * log(SUM))`, where `SUM` is sum of all numbers in array. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def splitArray(self, nums, m):
        def check(Q):
            if max(nums) > Q: return False
            acc, ans = 0, 1
            for num in nums:
                if acc + num <= Q:
                    acc += num
                else:
                    acc = num
                    ans += 1
            return ans <= m
        
        beg, end = max(nums) - 1, sum(nums)
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if check(mid):
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid
        
        return end
```

#### Solution 2
Another solution is use DP: let `dp[i][j]` be an answer for first `i` numbers and `j` groups. Then to evaluate `dp[i][j]` we need to look find $\min\limits_k$[max(dp[k][j-1], S_k-S_i)], where $S_k$ are cumulative sums. To find this minimum we can either use linear search with $O(m n^2)$, but it will give TLE. Alternative is to use binary search, where we use the property that first term of max is increasing and the second is decreasing. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(mn\log n)$, space is $O(n)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def splitArray(self, nums, m):
        n = len(nums)
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
        dp = list(acc)
        
        for j in range(1, m):
            for i in range(n, j, -1):
                beg, end = j - 1, i
                while beg + 1 < end:
                    mid = (beg + end)//2
                    if dp[mid] >= acc[i] - acc[mid]:
                        end = mid
                    else:
                        beg = mid
                    dp[i] = min(max(dp[end], acc[i] - acc[end]), max(dp[beg], acc[i] - acc[beg]))
        
        return dp[-1]
```
