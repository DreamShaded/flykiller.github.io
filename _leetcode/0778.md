#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/

#### Solution 1

First solution is to use Union Find data structure: on each moment of time we can update connected component and wait for the moment when `0` and `N^2-1` are in the same component. 

#### Complexity
Complexity is `O(N^2 *log N)` if we use union find with ranks (in code above) and `O(N^2)` if we use it with ranks and paths compression. Space complexity is `O(N^2)`.

#### Code
```python
class DSU(object):
    def __init__(self, N):
        self.par = list(range(N))
        self.rnk = [0] * N

    def find(self, x):
        if self.par[x] != x:
            self.par[x] = self.find(self.par[x])
        return self.par[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        xr, yr = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if xr == yr:
            return False
        elif self.rnk[xr] < self.rnk[yr]:
            self.par[xr] = yr
        elif self.rnk[xr] > self.rnk[yr]:
            self.par[yr] = xr
        else:
            self.par[yr] = xr
            self.rnk[xr] += 1
        return True

class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid):
        d, N = {}, len(grid)
        for i,j in product(range(N), range(N)):
            d[grid[i][j]] = (i, j)
        
        dsu = DSU(N*N)
        grid = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)] 
        neib_list = [[0,1],[0,-1],[1,0],[-1,0]]
        
        for i in range(N*N):
            x, y = d[i]
            grid[x][y] = 1
            for dx, dy in neib_list:
                if N>x+dx>=0 and N>y+dy>=0 and grid[x+dx][y+dy] == 1:
                    dsu.union((x+dx)*N + y + dy, x*N + y)
                    
            if dsu.find(0) == dsu.find(N*N-1): return i
```

#### Solution 2
There is also solution, using heaps: we perform usual dfs, start with `(0,0)` corner, but on each moment of time we choose node with smallest value to visit. In this way when we reached `(N-1, N-1)` corner, the answer will be the maximum of visited cells so far. 

#### Complexity
Complexity is again `O(N^2 *log N)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid):
        N, heap, visited, res = len(grid), [(grid[0][0], 0, 0)], set([(0, 0)]), 0
        
        for i in range(N*N):
            val, x, y = heappop(heap)
            res = max(res, val)
            if x == N-1 and y == N-1: return res
            neib_list = [[0,1],[0,-1],[1,0],[-1,0]]
            
            for dx, dy in neib_list:
                if (x + dx, y + dy) not in visited and 0<=x+dx<N and 0<=y+dy<N:
                    heappush(heap, (grid[x+dx][y+dy], x+dx, y+dy))
                    visited.add((x+dx, y+dy))
```

#### Remark
Finally, there is Binary Search solution, where we ask question, given day `D` if we can reach end point or not. Time complexity is again `O(N^2 * log N)`.
