#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/

#### Solution
Just do inorder traversal with stack (see problem **0094**). Then we have complexity `O(h + k)`, where `h` is the height of tree. If we want to do it a lot of times, we can keep number of all children for each node, which is `O(n)` memory, then we can have $O(h)$ complexity to find `k`-th element, using something like binary search.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(h + k)`, space complexity is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root, k):
        stack, curr = [], root
        
        while stack or curr:
            while curr:
                stack.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
            curr = stack.pop()
            
            if k == 1:
                return curr.val
            
            k -= 1
            curr = curr.right
```
