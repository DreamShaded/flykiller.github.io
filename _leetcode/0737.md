#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-ii/

#### Solution
Natural extension of problem **0734**, here we need to create graph of connections. Then we just can perform dfs for each pair in `pairs` and have `O(P * N)` time complexity, where `P` is size of `pairs` and `N` is size of `words1` and `words2`. 
We can also perform dfs only once and find connected components in graph in `O(N)` time and then for each pair check similarity in `O(1)`.

#### Complexity
Overall complexity is `O(N+P)`. Space complexity is `O(N)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def areSentencesSimilarTwo(self, words1, words2, pairs):
        G, V, comps, idx = defaultdict(list), set(), {}, 0
        for x, y in pairs:
            G[x].append(y)
            G[y].append(x)

        def dfs(node, idx):
            V.add(node)
            comps[node] = idx
            for child in G[node]:
                if child not in V:
                    dfs(child, idx)

        for node in G.keys():
            if node not in V:
                dfs(node, idx)
                idx += 1
                
        if len(words1) != len(words2): return False

        for x, y in zip(words1, words2):
            if x != y and comps.get(x, -1) != comps.get(y, -2): return False

        return True
```

#### Remark
Finally, there is Union Find approach, where we again found connected components with the same complexity.
