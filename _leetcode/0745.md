#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/prefix-and-suffix-search/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/prefix-and-suffix-search/

#### Solution 1
Let `n` be number of words, `L` be maximum length of word. One of the cool ways to solve this problem is the following: imagine, we have word `apple`, then what we need to find is substring `suffix + # + prefix` in string `apple#apple`. Now, quick way to find substring is for example create Trie with all suffixes of `apple#apple`, which include `#`.
 
#### Complexity
It is `O(nL^2)` time and space for `init`: for each word we need `O(L^2)` processing time. For `f` we need `O(L)` time and `O(1)` space, because we just traverse through tree. So, final complexity is `O(nL^2 + QL)`, where `Q` is number of queries.
 

#### Code
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.index = 0

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word, index): #None
        root = self.root
        root.index = index
        for symbol in word:
            root = root.children.setdefault(symbol, TrieNode())
            root.index = index
        
    def startsWith(self, word):
        root = self.root
        for symbol in word:
            if symbol not in root.children:
                return -1
            root = root.children[symbol]
        return root.index  


class WordFilter:
    def __init__(self, words):
        self.trie = Trie()
        self.words = {}
        
        for index, word in enumerate(words):
            long = word + "#" + word
            for i in range(len(word)):
                self.trie.insert(long[i:], index)
                
    def f(self, prefix, suffix):
        return self.trie.startsWith(suffix + "#" + prefix)
```

#### Solution 2
Finally, there is again solution with `O(nL^3)` time complexity, but without Tries at all: we just generate for each word all `O(L^2)` possible prefix/suffix pairs and put them into dictionary. It is working the best in practice, even though complexity is higher. This is because `L` is quite small and trie is quite heavy data structure with all connections, whereas here we keep only strings.

#### Complexity
Time is `O(nL^3 + QL)`, space is `O(nL^3)`.

#### Code
```python
class WordFilter:
    def __init__(self, words):
        self.d = {}
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            for p, s in product(range(len(word) + 1), repeat=2):
                self.d[word[:p], word[s:]] = i

    def f(self, prefix, suffix):
        return self.d.get((prefix, suffix), -1)
```
