#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/

#### Solution
What we actually need is to evaluate level of each node.  We can use `dfs` for it.  If we have `None` node, level is `0`.  Else, we evaluate maximum of levels of children and add $1$.  I put nodes in `defaultdict(list)` and then create list. 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is $O(n)$

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findLeaves(self, root):
        def dfs(root):
            if not root: return 0

            left_cand = dfs(root.left)
            right_cand = dfs(root.right)
            lev = max(left_cand, right_cand) + 1
            levels[lev].append(root.val)
            return lev

        levels = defaultdict(list)
        dfs(root)
        return [levels[i+1] for i in range(len(levels))]
```
