#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/

#### Solution
For each number, let us look at the last bit, e.g in number `10100111000100`, we look at 2-nd place from the end (starting with zero index), then what we can do is two options: 
1. Move this one to the right, we need `4` operations in this case in general case `2^i`. Actually if we started to move to the rigth, we continue until we remove this one at all and we need `2^{i+1} - 1` operations for this.
2. Move this one to the left, we need `8` operations in this case, in general case `2^(i+1)`.

Also we need to deal with cases whan we can not move to the right, like `....110000`, then we can either move to the left or remove one so we have `....010000`.

#### Complexity
I think it is `O(log n)`, however I do not have strict proof: intuition, that if in the beginning we have number with `k` ones, than on each next level we have no more than two numbers with `k-1`, `k-2`, ..., `1` ones.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(n):
            if n == 0: return 0
            if n & (n-1) == 0: return 2*n - 1
            p = n - (n & (n-1))
            if (2*p) & n == (2*p):
                return min(dp(n-2*p) + 1, dp(n-p) + 2*p-1)
            return min(dp(n-p) + 2*p-1, dp(n+p) + p*2)
        
        return dp(n)
```

#### Solution 2
Actually, there is better solution. 

Lemma: shortest path from `10..00` to `00..00` where we have `n` zeros has length `2^(n+1) - 1`.

Then imagine, that we have number `101101000`, and we want to get `000000000`. We can split path as following:

`000000000`
...
`101101000`
...
`100000000`

We know that whole path has length `2^(n+1) - 1`, then to find answer to our question we need to subtract from `2^(n+1) - 1` the length of path from `101101000` to `100000000`: if we have `3` pointes `(A, B, C)` and we know that path from `A` to `C` go through `B` and we know shortest path from `A` to `B` and from `A` to `C`, than we know it from `B` to `C`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(n):
            if n == 0: return 0
            b = int(log2(n))
            return (1<<(b + 1)) - 1 - dp(n - (1<<b))
        
        return dp(n)
```

#### Remark
Actually, what we have in this problem is called Gray code, see https://oeis.org/A006068.
