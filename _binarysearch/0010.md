Almost the same as leetcode Leetcode 0070. Climbing Stairs

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        dp, M = (1, 1), 10**9 + 7
        for i in range(n-1):
            dp = (dp[1] % M, (dp[0] + dp[1]) % M)
        return dp[1]
```
