#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-make-array-complementary/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-make-array-complementary/

#### Solution
The idea for each pair of complementary numbers, imagine `3`, `4` and `limit = 6`. Then we can get numbers from `2` to `12`, and we need the following number of moves:

`[inf, inf, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`

So, to get `7` we need zero moves, because `3 + 4` already equal to `7`. To get `4, 5, 6` we can make `1` move: for example to get `4` we can make it as `3 + 1`, and so on. Also we can get numbers `8, 9, 10`, using `1` move. In general, to make `1` move, we can get numbers from `min(a,b) + 1` to `max(a,b) + limit`.

Now, we need to get this array for all pairs of complementary numbers and sum all of them and find element with smallest value. There is a trick, how we can do it efficiently: first of all, let us invert array, that is consider

`[inf, inf, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0].`

And then we use cumulative sums trick, if we add two following arrays, than cumulative sum will be exactly what we need.

`[inf, inf, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0]`

`[inf, inf, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

So, we just do what we discussed, and get the solution.

#### Complexity
Time complexity `O(n + k)`, where `k` is our `limit` and `n` is length of `nums`. Space complexity is `O(k)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums, k):
        n = len(nums)//2
        diffs = [0]*(2*k+2)
        for i in range(n):
            a, b = nums[i], nums[-1-i]
            diffs[min(a,b) + 1] += 1
            diffs[max(a,b) + k+1] -= 1
            diffs[a+b] += 1
            diffs[a+b+1] -= 1

        return 2*n - max(accumulate(diffs))
```
