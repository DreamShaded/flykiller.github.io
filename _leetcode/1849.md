title: Leetcode 1849 Splitting a String Into Descending Consecutive Values
tags: [dp, backtracking]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/splitting-a-string-into-descending-consecutive-values/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/splitting-a-string-into-descending-consecutive-values/

#### Solution
The idea is to use dp with states `dp(i, num)`, where we try to split string `s[i:]` such that it starts with `num`.

#### Complexity
We have at most `n` values for `i` and upto `n` values for `num`. So, it total we have `O(n^2)` states, each of them have `O(n)` transitions, each of which needed `O(n)` time to process `num`, because numbers can have length upto `n`. So, total time complexity is `O(n^4)`, space is `O(n^3)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def splitString(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, num):
            if i == n: return 0
            ans = -float("inf")
            for j in range(i + 1, n+1):
                if int(s[i:j]) == num - 1:
                    ans = max(ans, 1 + dp(j, num - 1))
            return ans
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if dp(i, int(s[:i])) > 0: return True
            
        return False  
```
