#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-permutations-for-di-sequence/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-permutations-for-di-sequence/

#### Solution
There is solution with `O(n^3)` time and `O(n^2)` space complexity, using dp and divide and conquer ideas. Let `dfs(i, j)` be answer for `S[i:j]` and ask question: where is `0` in our sequence? There can be `3` cases:

1. Sequence starts with `I`, then `0` can be in the beginning and we have `dfs(i + 1, j)` options.
2. Sequence ends with `D`, then `0` can be in the end and we have `dfs(i, j - 1)` options.
3. `0` in the middle, and we are looking for `DI`. Imagine we have `IDI|DI|DII`, then what we can state is the following: we need to solve problem for `IDI` and for `DII` parts. Also we need to multiply it by number of combinations: here `C_8^4`: this is how many ways we have to choose set of number for left part (number for right part will be chosen automatically)

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^3)` for time and `O(n^2)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numPermsDISequence(self, S):
        n, N = len(S), 10**9 + 7
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs_comb(i, j):
            if j == 0 or i == j: return 1
            return (dfs_comb(i-1, j) + dfs_comb(i-1, j-1)) % N
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i, j):
            if j <= i + 1: return 1
            ans = 0
            if S[j-1] == "D": ans += dfs(i, j - 1)
            if S[i] == "I"  : ans += dfs(i + 1, j)
            for l in range(i, j - 1):
                if S[l:l+2] == "DI":
                    ans += dfs(i,l) * dfs(l+2,j) * dfs_comb(j-i, l+1-i)
            return ans % N
        
        return dfs(0, n)
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(n^2)` time solution: define by `dp[i][j]` number of permutations of `0, 1, ..., i-1` which ends with `j`, it also be the number of answers for `s[:i]` which ends with `j`. Then we have:

1. if `s[i-1] == "I"` then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][0] + dp[i-1][1] + ... + dp[i-1][j-1]`
2. if `s[i-1] == "D"` then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j+1] + ... + dp[i-1][i-1]`

Imagine each time when appending the j to the previous permutations, you have to add 1 to each number in the previous permutation which is greater than or equals to `j`. In this way, we keep the orders and counts of previous permutations and cumulate.

eg. We already have permutation `(1, 0, 3, 2)`. We are trying to append `2`. Now the `(1, 0, 3, 2)` changes to `(1, 0, 4, 3)` then appended with a `2`. We have `(1, 0, 4, 3, 2)`. Although the values change but the order and count don't change.

Also we need to keep cumulative prefixes and sufixes to make it `O(n^2)`.
