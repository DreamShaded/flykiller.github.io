#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Intervals-Intersecting-at-Point/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Intervals-Intersecting-at-Point/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked: for each segment check if point is inside it.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, I, P):
        return sum(x <= P <= y for x, y in I)
```
