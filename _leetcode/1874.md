#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-product-sum-of-two-arrays/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-product-sum-of-two-arrays/

#### Solution
Actually it is trans-inequality: minimim will be the smallest if for each biggest value in the first array we choose the smallest num in the second array.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space is `O(n)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minProductSum(self, nums1, nums2):
        return sum(x*y for x,y in zip(sorted(nums1), sorted(nums2)[::-1]))
```
