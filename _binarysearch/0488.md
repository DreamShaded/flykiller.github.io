title: BinarySearch 0488 Circular Longest Increasing Subsequence
tags: [LIS, dp, binary search]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Circular-Longest-Increasing-Subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Circular-Longest-Increasing-Subsequence/

#### Solution
For each of `n` possible shifts find LIS.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^2 log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        def LIS(nums):
            dp = [10**10] * (len(nums) + 1)
            for elem in nums: dp[bisect_left(dp, elem)] = elem  
            return dp.index(10**10)
        return max(LIS(nums[i:] + nums[:i]) for i in range(len(nums)))
```
