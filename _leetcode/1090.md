#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-values-from-labels/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-values-from-labels/

#### Solution
We sort items by value and try to choose the most valueable one. We keep how much we take in total as well how much we taken of each type.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def largestValsFromLabels(self, values, labels, numWanted, useLimit):
        arr = sorted([(x, y) for x, y in zip(values, labels)])[::-1]
        taken_types = Counter()
        ans = 0
        for x, y in arr:
            if numWanted == 0: break
            if taken_types[y] >= useLimit: continue
            ans += x
            taken_types[y] += 1
            numWanted -= 1
            
        return ans
```
