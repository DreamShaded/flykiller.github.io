<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Ascending-Cards/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Ascending-Cards/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, deck):
        n = len(deck)
        idx = deque(range(n))
        ans = [-1] * n
        for card in sorted(deck):
            ans[idx.popleft()] = card
            if idx: idx += [idx.popleft()]
                
        return ans
```
