#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Median-Minimization/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Median-Minimization/

#### Solution
If we sort numbers and look at the two middle ones, this will be the optimal difference. It is not diffiuclt to prove, but I skip it for the moment.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        nums = sorted(nums)
        n = len(nums)
        return nums[n//2] - nums[n//2 - 1]
```
