title: Leetcode 0030. Substring with Concatenation of All Words
tags: [hash table, string, sliding window]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/

#### Solution
The idea is the following: first, we can divide this problem into several sub-problems, because all words have the same length, `barfoothefoobarman` is divided into groups`{bar, foo, the, foo, bar, man}`, `{arf, oot, hef, oob, arm}` and `{rfo, oth, efo, oba, rma}` and then problem is similar to **0438**, where we need to find anagram substring. We use dictionary with words and number of occurrences and use sliding window technique, keeping number of correct values.

#### Complexity
Overall complexity of this algorithm is $O(nk)$, where $n$ is size of original string and $k$ is the length of each word. Memory is$O(n)$: on each group we need to keep no more that one copy of string.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findSubstring(self, s, words):
        n, k, m = len(s), len(words), len(words[0])
        ans = []
        
        for j in range(m):
            d1, d2 = Counter(words), Counter()
            
            num_to_correct = len(d1)     
            for i in range(j, n, m):
                new_s = s[i:i+m]
                d2[new_s] += 1
                if d1[new_s] == d2[new_s]:
                    num_to_correct -= 1
                if d2[new_s] == d1[new_s] + 1:
                    num_to_correct += 1
                    
                if i - m*k >= 0:
                    old_s = s[i-m*k:i-m*k+m]
                    d2[old_s] -= 1
                    if d2[old_s] == d1[old_s] - 1:
                        num_to_correct += 1
                    if d1[old_s] == d2[old_s]:
                        num_to_correct -= 1
                        
                if num_to_correct == 0:
                    ans.append(i+m-m*k)
                    
        return ans
```
