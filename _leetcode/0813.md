#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-sum-of-averages/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-sum-of-averages/

#### Solution
Let `dfs(i, k)` be answer for `A[:i+1]` with we need to split into `k` parts. Then, first of all, we consider only cases, when `i >= k-1`, and if `i == k - 1`, we return cumulative sum of first `i` elements: it means, that all groups should have length $1$. Also, if we have only `1` group, that is `k = 1`, we return `CS[i]/(i+1)`. Finally, we do recursion: for `j in range(k - 2, i)`, we run `dfs(j, k - 1)` and evaluate mean in last group.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2k)`: we have `nk` different states and at most `k` transitions from one state to another. Space complexity is `O(nk)`, it can be reduced to `O(n)`, because each level we increase $k$ only by one.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def largestSumOfAverages(self, A, K):
        CS = list(accumulate(A))
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i, k):
            if k == 1: return CS[i]/(i+1)
            if i == k - 1: return CS[i]
            return max(dfs(j, k - 1) + (CS[i] - CS[j])/(i-j) for j in range(k-2, i))
     
        return dfs(len(A) - 1, K)
```

#### Remark
I wonder if it is possible to do something like Knuth optimization here with total complexity `O(nk)`.
