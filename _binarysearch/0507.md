#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Special-Nodes/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Special-Nodes/

#### Solution 1
First solution is to notice that if we keep sets for unique colors for each node and when we merget two children and follow the strategy: merge smaller to bigger, than we will have good complexity: I think it can be proved that it is `O(n log n)`. In python when we traverse tree with dfs, what is returned is pointer to array, not the copy, that is why it works.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, tree, color):
        self.ans = 0

        def dfs(par, node):
            ans, cnt = set([color[node]]), 1
            for child in tree[node]:
                if child == par: continue
                x, cnt_x = dfs(node, child)
                if len(x) > len(ans):
                    x |= ans
                    ans = x
                else:
                    ans |= x
                cnt += cnt_x
            self.ans += (len(ans) == cnt)
            return ans, cnt


        dfs(-1, 0)
        return self.ans
```

#### Solution 2
There is another solution using euler traversal of graph, or pre-order traversal.

1. `col` is colors of nodes in our traversal.
2. `beg` is first encounter of node `i`.
3. `end` is the last encounter of node `i`. Now subtree is kept in `[beg, end]`.

Now, we have two main steps:
1. Traverse tree to get `col, beg, end`.
2. Use sliding window (two pointers approach) to answer for each start what is the rightest point we can reach such that all colors are different.

1. `f` is color counter
2. `d` is the look back index ranging to where the colors are unique
3. `j` is the front pointer for the two pointers way of iterating the unique-color-ranges

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, tree, color):
        n = len(color)
        beg, end, col, d = [0]*n, [0]*n ,[0]*n, [0]*n
        self.idx = 0
        def dfs(par, node):
            col[self.idx] = color[node]
            beg[node]= self.idx
            self.idx += 1
            for child in tree[node]:
                if child != par: dfs(node, child)
            end[node] = self.idx

        dfs(-1, 0)
        f = Counter()
        j = -1

        for i in range(n):
            while f[col[i]]:
                j += 1
                f[col[j]] -= 1
            f[col[i]] += 1
            d[i] = j

        return sum(d[end[x] - 1] < beg[x] for x in range(n))
```

#### Remark
There is also solution using union find.
