tags: [dfs, bfs, array]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/nested-list-weight-sum/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/nested-list-weight-sum/

#### Solution
Here we need to keep a function `getSum(elem, depth)`, which recursively call itself. If `elem` is Integer (function given to your), then just return `elem.getInteger() * depth`. In opposite case we need to call `getSum(e, depth + 1)` for all `e in elem.getList()`. Actually, we can look at this as graph traversal algorithm, more specifically we use dfs here.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$, space is $O(h)$, where $h$ is the biggest depth.\\

#### Code
```python
class Solution:    
    def depthSum(self, nestedList):
        return sum([self.getSum(e, 1) for e in nestedList])
        
    def getSum(self, elem, depth):
        if elem.isInteger():
            return elem.getInteger() * depth 
        else:
            return sum([self.getSum(e, depth + 1) for e in elem.getList()])
```
