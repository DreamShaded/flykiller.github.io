title: Leetcode 1289. Minimum Falling Path Sum II
tags: [dp, 2d-array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum-ii/

#### Solution
Actually this is the same problem as **0265** Paint House II.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n^2)`, space is `O(n)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minFallingPathSum(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        dp = [0]*n
        
        for row in arr:
            dp2 = [0] * n
            min_ind = dp.index(min(dp))
            for i in range(n):
                if i != min_ind:
                    dp2[i] = dp[min_ind] + row[i]
                else:
                    dp2[i] = min(dp[i] for i in range(n) if i != min_ind) + row[i]
                    
            dp = dp2
            
        return min(dp)
```
