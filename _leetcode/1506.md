#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-root-of-n-ary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-root-of-n-ary-tree/

#### Solution
Just traverse tree and find node with indegree 0. Or we can calculate size of subtree for each node and then choose the maximum one. If we you memoisation, time will be linear.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findRoot(self, tree):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(node):
            return sum([dfs(child) for child in node.children]) + 1
        
        return max([node for node in tree], key = lambda x:dfs(x))
```
