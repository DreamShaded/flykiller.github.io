#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/

#### Solution
One possible way is to transform our times to numbers between `0` and `24*60 - 1` and sort them, then choose the minimum difference between adjacent points and also do not forget about difference between maximum and `24 * 60` minus minimum.

#### Complexity
Time complexity will be `O(n log n)`, space complexity `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints):
        times = sorted([int(x[:2])*60 + int(x[3:]) for x in timePoints])
        return min(min(y-x for x, y in zip(times, times[1:])), times[0] + 1440 - times[-1])   
```

#### Remark
We can also use optimization, that if we have `> 24 * 60` times, by pigeonhole principle we need to return `0`. Also we can use bucket sort with `O(24 * 60)` time and memory, which is more preferable for big data.
