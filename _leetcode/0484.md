#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-permutation/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-permutation/

#### Solution
The trick is to use greedy approach: we need to find first how many `D` we have, for example `DDDD`, and then we need to add five numbers decreasing by one. Consider example `DDDDIIIIDDIDDDII`, then our `ret` will change like this: 

1. `[]`
2. `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
3. `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6]`
4. `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7]`
5. `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7, 8]`
6. `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7, 8, 11, 10, 9]`
7. `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7, 8, 11, 10, 9, 15, 14, 13, 12]`
8. `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7, 8, 11, 10, 9, 15, 14, 13, 12, 16]`

So, after each iteration we always have all numbers in range `[1, k]` for some `k`.

#### Complexity
 Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findPermutation(self, s):
        ret = []
        for i in range(len(s) + 1):
            if i == len(s) or s[i] == "I":
                ret += range(i+1, len(ret), -1)
        return ret
```
