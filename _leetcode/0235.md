#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/

#### Solution
In this problem we have BST so we can use this property. We use `dfs(root)` function, and we can have options:
1. `root.val > max(p.val, q.val)`: in this case we do not have any option except of going to the left: all right subtree is too big for us because of BST property.
2. `root.val < min(p.val, q.val)`: in this case we go to the right, because all left subtree is too small.
3. Finally if we have `root.val` between `min(p.val, q.val)` and `max(p.val, q.val)`, it means that we found desired node

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(h)`: the height of our tree. It can go upto `n`, but for balanced BST it is `O(log n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        self.Found = None
        
        def dfs(root):
            if root.val > max(p.val, q.val):
                dfs(root.left)
            elif root.val < min(p.val, q.val):
                dfs(root.right)
            else:
                self.Found = root
                
        dfs(root)
        return self.Found
