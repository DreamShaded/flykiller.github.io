#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Linked-List-Folding/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Linked-List-Folding/

#### Solution
We can create list from linked list, then fold our list and then create linked list back.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, head):
        arr, cur = [], head
        while cur:
            arr.append(cur.val)
            cur = cur.next

        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(n // 2):
            arr[~i] += arr[i]

        i = n // 2
        ans = cur = LLNode(arr[i])
        while i + 1 < n:
            i += 1
            cur.next = cur = LLNode(arr[i])
        return ans
```

#### Remark
It is also possible to do it in `O(1)` additional space: we need to find middle, reverse the second half and then add it to the first half.
