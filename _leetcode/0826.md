tags: [array, two pointers, binary search]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/

#### Solution
Let us create `diff_prof` array with difficulty/profit pairs and sort it. Then we update profits we can gain: it is cumulative maximum of profits. So, now we spend `O(n log n)` time so far. Finally, we iterate through workers and do binary search for each worker: find the biggest gain he can have.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n + Q log n)`, space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
from bisect import bisect

class Solution:
    def maxProfitAssignment(self, difficulty, profit, worker):
        diff_prof = sorted([[i, j] for i, j in zip(difficulty, profit)])
        
        for i in range(1, len(diff_prof)):
            diff_prof[i][1] = max(diff_prof[i-1][1], diff_prof[i][1]) 
        
        gain = 0
        
        for w in worker:
            ind = bisect(diff_prof, [w, float("inf")])
            if ind > 0: gain += diff_prof[ind-1][1]
        return gain
```

#### Remark
We can do it in alternative way: iterate over sorted workers and update gain we can have for each of them. Time complexity is `O(n log n + q log q)`.
