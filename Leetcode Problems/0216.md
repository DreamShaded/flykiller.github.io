If in problem we need to return all possible options with some property, usually it means that we need to do backtracking. Let us use `BackTr` function with parameters:

1. `k` is number of numbers we need to take to build our number.
2. `n` is number we need to build
3. `curr_sol` built solution so far.

Then if `n<0` of `k<0` we need to go back; if `n==0` and `k==0` means that we found solution, so we add it to our `self.sol`. Then we just run our `BackTr` with parameters: `k-1`: we need to take one less number, `n-i`, where `i` is the last digit we added: it is either starts with `1` or with `curr_sol[-1] + 1` and `curr_sol + [i]` will be our built solution so far.

Finally, we run ` self.BackTr(k, n, [])` and return `self.sol`.

**Comlexity**: For first digit we have not more than `9` options, for second one no more than `8` and so on, so there will be `9*8*...*(9-k+1)` possible options, for each of which we need `O(k)`. We can improve this bound if we take into account that there is 2^9 possible combinations at all, so complexity is `O(2^9*k)`, because of all dead-ends we can have. Space complexity is `O(k)`, if we do not take into account output solution.

```
class Solution:
    def combinationSum3(self, k, n):
        self.sol = []
        self.BackTr(k, n, [])
        return self.sol
        
    def BackTr(self, k, n, curr_sol):
        if n < 0 or k < 0: return
        if n == 0 and k == 0:
            self.sol.append(curr_sol)
            
        start = curr_sol[-1] + 1 if curr_sol else 1
            
        for i in range(start, 10):
            self.BackTr(k - 1, n - i, curr_sol + [i])
```
