---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Unix-Path-Resolution/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Unix-Path-Resolution/

#### Solution
The same as Leetcode 0071. Simplify Path, just different format of I/O

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, path):
        stack = []
        for elem in path:
            if stack and elem == "..":
                stack.pop()
            elif elem not in [".", "", ".."]:
                stack.append(elem)
                
        return stack
```
