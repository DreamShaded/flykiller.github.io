#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Even-Value-Path/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Even-Value-Path/

#### Solution
Use dfs which answer question `(longest left path, longest right path)` for given node. This is similar like what we did when we look for diameter.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(h)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, root):
        self.ans = 0
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return (0, 0)
            l1, r1 = dfs(node.left)
            l2, r2 = dfs(node.right)
            if node.val % 2 == 1:
                return (0, 0)
            else:
                l, r = max(l1, r1) + 1, max(l2, r2) + 1
                self.ans = max(self.ans, l + r - 1)
                return l, r

        dfs(root)
        return self.ans
        
```
