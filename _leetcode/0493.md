#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-pairs/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-pairs/

#### Solution 1
There is solution, using Binary Indexed Tree (BIT). The idea is traverse our `nums` from the end and add them to our BIT. Let us look at the example `[2,4,4,3,5,1]`. Let us look at our BIT after each addition. Let us also look at list, which this BIT represents: it will change like this:
$$[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \to 
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \to 
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] \to 
[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] \to$$
$$[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1] \to
[1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1] \to
[1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1]$$
We can see here for example we have `0` and `2`, because we have two equal numbers in our `nums`. Then for each `num` we first find the place where `num/2` should be if numbers were sorted and took corresponding number from our BIT.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space

#### Code
```python
class BIT:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.sums = [0] * (n+1)
    
    def update(self, i, delta):
        while i < len(self.sums):
            self.sums[i] += delta
            i += i & (-i)
    
    def query(self, i):
        res = 0
        while i > 0:
            res += self.sums[i]
            i -= i & (-i)
        return res

class Solution:
    def reversePairs(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        nums_copy = sorted(nums)
        tree = BIT(n)
        count = 0
        
        for num in reversed(nums):
            count += tree.query(bisect_left(nums_copy, num/2))
            tree.update(bisect.bisect(nums_copy, num), 1)
        return count
```

#### Solution 2
Here is very short SortedList solution, with the same complexity.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n log n)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.


#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class Solution:
    def reversePairs(self, nums):
        SList, ans = SortedList(), 0   
        for length, num in enumerate(nums):
            ans += len(SList) - SList.bisect(2*num)
            SList.add(num)       
        return ans
```

See also problem **0315** Count of Smaller Numbers After Self, **0327** Count of Range Sum. I think any problem of this type with list of numbers `nums` can be solved either with BST, Segment Tree or BIT. There is also merge sort solution, I did not explored yet.
