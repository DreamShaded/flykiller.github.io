title: Leetcode 1485 Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer
tags: [tree, dfs, bfs, hash table]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-binary-tree-with-random-pointer/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-binary-tree-with-random-pointer/

#### Solution
This problem is similar to problem **133** Clone graph. The idea is to create hash table of connections between old and new trees. We traverse tree with dfs and each time when we see that node is not visited, we create new pair in hash table. Also we run `mapping[node].left = dfs(node.left)`, that is recursevily create pairs for left children, similarly for right and random. 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def copyRandomBinaryTree(self, root):
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return 
            if node not in mapping: 
                mapping[node] = NodeCopy(node.val)
                mapping[node].left = dfs(node.left)
                mapping[node].right = dfs(node.right)
                mapping[node].random = dfs(node.random)
            return mapping[node]
        
        mapping = {}
        return dfs(root)
```

#### Remark
Also you can solve it in almost the same way I did for problem **133**, but then you first need to run dfs for usual tree and then once again another dfs only for random pointers.

### 1490 Clone N-ary Tree

[tree, hash table, dfs, bfs]

#### Solution
This problem is exactly the same as **133** Clone Graph

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def cloneTree(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        def dfs(node):
            mapping[node] = Node(node.val)
            for neigh in node.children:
                if neigh not in mapping: dfs(neigh)
                mapping[node].children += [mapping[neigh]]
        
        if not root: return root
        mapping  = {}
        dfs(root)
        return mapping[root]
```

### 1500 Design a File Sharing System

[design, hash table, heap]

#### Solution
We need to keep the following pieces of information:

1. `self.chunk_user` is connection: for each chunk we keep all users that have it.
2. `self.user_chunk` is for every user we keep all chunks it have.
3. `self.heap` is heap of avaliable id.

The functions will work like this:

1. `join(ownedChunks)`. First, we need to find `id` of new user: if we have elements in heap, extract it from it, if not, allocate maximum we have +1. Also we need to update `chunk_user` and `user_chunk`.
2. `leave(userID)`: we need to update `chunk_user` and delete `user_chunk`. Also we add new `id` to our heap.
3. `request(userID, chunkID)`: first we create candidates: all users who have this chunk. Then if candidates are not empty, we update `chunk_user` and `user_chunk`: only in this case this user can get this chunk.

#### Complexity
Time complexity for `join` is `O(S + log T)`, where `S = len(ownedChunks)` and `T = len(heap)`. Time complexity for `leave` is `O(S + log T)`. Time complexity of `cands` is `O(S log S)`.

#### Code
```python
class FileSharing:
    def __init__(self, m: int):
        self.chunk_user = defaultdict(set)
        self.user_chunk = defaultdict(set)
        self.heap = []  #queue of free ids
        
    def join(self, ownedChunks):
        user = heappop(self.heap) if self.heap else len(self.user_chunk) + 1
        for i in ownedChunks: self.chunk_user[i].add(user)
        self.user_chunk[user] = set(ownedChunks)
        return user
        
    def leave(self, userID):
        for chunk in self.user_chunk[userID]:
            self.chunk_user[chunk].remove(userID)
            
        heappush(self.heap, userID)
        del self.user_chunk[userID]
        
    def request(self, userID, chunkID):
        cands = sorted(list(self.chunk_user[chunkID]))
        
        if cands:
            self.chunk_user[chunkID].add(userID)
            self.user_chunk[userID].add(chunkID)
        
        return cands
```
