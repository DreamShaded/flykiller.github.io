This problem is nothing else, but generalization of problem **392. Is Subsequence**, but here here we have one main string `s` and bunch of substrings we need to look inside. You can see my solution for this problem here
https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/discuss/678389/Python-3-Solutions%3A-DP-2-pointers-and-follow-up-BS-explained

Let us now iterate over strings `d` here and if we found subsequence of `s`, we update our `ans`: fisrt check length and then lexicographical order.

**Complexity**: time complexity will be `O(mn)`, where `m` is number of strings in `d` and `n` is length of `s`. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s, t):
        s_i, t_i = 0, 0
        while s_i < len(s) and t_i < len(t):
            s_i, t_i = s_i + (s[s_i] == t[t_i]), t_i + 1
        return s_i == len(s)
    
    def findLongestWord(self, s, d):
        ans = ""
        for string in d:
            if self.isSubsequence(string, s):
                ans = min(ans, string, key = lambda x: (-len(x), x))
        return ans
```

**PS**: there is also very elegant oneliner for isSubsequence function, which has the same complexity as my function, but works several times faster due to low-level python language optimizations. However, I think nobody expect this code on real interview and it is more for constests trick in my opinion.
```
return all(c in (t:=iter(t)) for c in s)
```
