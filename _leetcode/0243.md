title: Leetcode 0243 Shortest Word Distance
tags: [string, two pointers, array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance/

#### Solution
Go from left to right and keep two pointers: for each of two words. Update them if new word equal to `word1` or `word2`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n)$ and space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, wordsDict, word1, word2):
        p1, p2 = -float("inf"), float("inf")
        ans = p2 - p1
        for i, word in enumerate(wordsDict):
            if word == word1:
                p1 = i
                ans = min(ans, abs(p2 - p1))
            if word == word2:
                p2 = i
                ans = min(ans, abs(p2 - p1))
                
        return ans
```
