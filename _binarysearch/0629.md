#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-Tree-From-Leaves/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-Tree-From-Leaves/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values, just return sum of all values here.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^3)` for time and `O(n^2)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        m = {(i, j): max(arr[i:j+1]) for i in range(n) for j in range(i, n)}
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == j: return arr[i]
            return min(dp(i, k) + dp(k + 1, j) + m[i, k]*m[k+1, j] for k in range(i, j))
            
        return dp(0, n - 1)  
```

#### Remark
There is also `O(n)` time complexity solution, using monotonic deque.
