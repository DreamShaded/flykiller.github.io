#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Flipped-Matrix-Prequel/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Flipped-Matrix-Prequel/

#### Solution
The idea is to calculate sum for each row and column and then we can calculate update in `O(1)` for every cell.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and `O(m + n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, M):
        m, n = len(M[0]), len(M)
        rows = [sum(row) for row in M]
        cols = [sum(col) for col in zip(*M)]
        upd = -float("inf")
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                upd = max(upd, n + m - 2*rows[i] - 2*cols[j] + 4*M[i][j] - 2)

        return sum(rows) + upd
```
