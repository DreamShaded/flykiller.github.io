#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sorted-Elements/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Sorted-Elements/

#### Solution
Just sort and check places.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        return sum(x == y for x, y in zip(nums, sorted(nums)))
```

#### Remark
See Leetcode 0581. Shortest Unsorted Continuous Subarray problem, where we have also `O(n)` time complexity solution.
