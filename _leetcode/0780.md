#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reaching-points/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/reaching-points/

#### Solution
The idea is start from the end, not from the beginning: in this way we always can make only one step: if we have `(a, b)` and `a < b`, then one reverse step is `(a, b - a)` and if `a > b`, it is `(a - b, b)`. So, we start from the end and check step by step. To make it faster one reverse step can be done as `(a%b, b%a)`, but in this way we need to make sure that we did not skip any solutions, like we have `(100, 7)` and we go directly to `(2, 7)`, and we need to check positions `(93, 7), (86, 7), ... (9, 7)`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log(sx) + log(sy))`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reachingPoints(self, sx, sy, tx, ty):
        while tx > 0 and ty > 0:
            if tx >= ty:
                if sy == ty and (tx-sx)%ty == 0 and tx >= sx: return True
            else:
                if sx == tx and (ty-sy)%tx == 0 and ty >= sy: return True
           
            tx, ty = tx%ty, ty%tx
        
        return False
```
