#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Distributed-Systems/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Distributed-Systems/

#### Solution
Just use classical Dijkstra here.

#### Complexity
It is `O((E + V) log V)` for time and `O(E + V)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, edges):
        dist = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        dist[0] = 0
        G = defaultdict(list)
        
        for a, b, w in edges:
            G[a].append((b, w))
            G[b].append((a, w))
        
        heap = [(0, 0)]

        while heap:
            min_dist, idx = heappop(heap)
            for neibh, weight in G[idx]:
                cand = min_dist + weight
                if cand < dist[neibh]:
                    dist[neibh] = cand
                    heappush(heap, (cand, neibh))
                    
        return max(dist)
```
