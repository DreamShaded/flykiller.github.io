tags: [dfs, tree, recursion]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-n-ary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-n-ary-tree/

#### Solution
Almost identical to problem **1245**. Tree Diameter, but here tree is already given, so it is even simpler.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def diameter(self, root):
        def dfs(node):
            maxs = [-1, -1]
            for neib in node.children:
                depth = dfs(neib)
                maxs = sorted(maxs + [depth])[-2:]
            self.res = max(self.res, sum(maxs) + 2)
            return maxs[1] + 1
        
        self.res = 0
        dfs(root)
        return self.res
```
