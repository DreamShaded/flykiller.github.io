#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/

#### Solution
Just do binary search in `O(log n)` complexity

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        beg, end = 1, n
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid + 1
        return beg
```
