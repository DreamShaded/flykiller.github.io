Nothing very special about this problem: we just need to iterate through our `words` and for each of them build string. It is actually can be done even in one line (not including `alphabet`) if we use double comperehsions, but this is up to you if you like oneliners.

**Complexity**: time and space complexity is `O(n*k)`, where `n` is number of words and `k` average is length of each word and we note that length of each encoding is not more than `4`. Space complexity is `O(n*k)` as well.

```python
class Solution:
    def uniqueMorseRepresentations(self, words):
        alphabet = [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
        ans = []
        for word in words:
            ans.append("".join(alphabet[ord(s)-ord("a")] for s in word))
        return len(set(ans))
```
