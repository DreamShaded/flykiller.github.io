#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Line-of-People/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Line-of-People/

#### Solution
We have equations `x <= b` and `x <= n - 1 - a`, from here we can get answer that `x` can be in `[0, min(b, n - 1 - a)]` and we have `min(b, n - 1 - a) + 1` options.

#### Complexity
It is `O(1)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, a, b):
        return min(b, n - 1 - a) + 1
```
