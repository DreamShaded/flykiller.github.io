#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/As-Before-Bs/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/As-Before-Bs/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced. The idea is to use `dp` with states `end_a` and `end_b`, where `end_a` is the minimum number of deletions such that we have last symbol `a` and similar for `b`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        end_a, end_b = 0,0 
        for val in s:
            if val == "A":
                end_b += 1
            else:
                end_a, end_b = end_a + 1, min(end_a, end_b)
        return min(end_a, end_b)
```
