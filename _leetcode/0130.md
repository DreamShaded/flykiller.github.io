In this problem we need to understand, what exactly surrouned by `'X'` means. It actually means that if we start from `'O'` at the border, and we traverse only `'O'`, only those `'O'` are **not surrouned** by `'X'`. So the plan is the following:

1. Start dfs or bfs from all `'O'`, which are on the border.
2. When we traverse them, let us color them as `'T'`, temporary color.
3. Now, when we traverse all we wanted, all colors which are not `'T'` need to renamed to `'X'` and all colors which are `'T'` need to be renamed to `'O'`, and that is all!

**Compexity**: time complextiy is `O(mn)`, where `m` and `n` are sizes of our board. Additional space complexity can also go upto `O(mn)` to keep stack of recursion.

```python
class Solution:
    def dfs(self, i, j):
      if i<0 or j<0 or i>=self.M or j>=self.N or self.board[i][j] != "O":
          return
      self.board[i][j] = 'T'
      neib_list = [[i+1,j],[i-1,j],[i,j-1],[i,j+1]]
      for x, y in neib_list:
        self.dfs(x, y)
    
    def solve(self, board):
        if not board: return 0
        self.board, self.M, self.N = board, len(board), len(board[0])
        
        for i in range(0, self.M):
            self.dfs(i,0)
            self.dfs(i,self.N-1)
            
        for j in range(0, self.N):
            self.dfs(0,j)
            self.dfs(self.M-1,j)
        
        for i,j in product(range(self.M), range(self.N)):
            board[i][j] = "X" if board[i][j] != "T" else "O"
```
