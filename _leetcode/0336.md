#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/

#### Solution
Let `n` be number of words and `k` be average length of word. Then there is trivial algorithm with complexity `O(n^2k)`. There is better algorithm: for each word we can evaluate all prefixes and suffixes, and check if they are palindromes: for example if we have `abcxxyxx, cba`, if we want to combine them we need suffix `xxyxx` to be palindrome; if we want to combine `abc, xyyxcba`, we want prefix `xyyx` to be palindrome. So we do the following steps:
 
 1. For each word, and each suffix/prefix of length `i`, we check if it is palindrome and if it is, we put prefix/suffix to our hash table `W_d`. Note, that for the case `abcxxyxx` we found suffix `xxyxx` which is palindrome, but we put prefix `abc` to our hash table. Note also that we need to handle the cases of empty suffixes/prefixes. For example if we have `abc` and `cba`, then we can connect these two strings in two ways, and we can say that we take empty prefix/suffix here. So, what will be kept in `W_d` is pairs `(t, ind)`, where `ind` is index of word and first element is `-1` for non-empty prefix, `1` for non-empty suffix and `0` for empty suffix **or** prefix.
 2. Now, we want to iterate through our `W` once again and for any word we look at `W_d[word[::-1]]`: possible candidates for this word. We need to make sure that candidate we found is not equal to word we consider at the moment. Next, if `one < 0`, it means, that we consider non-empty prefixes, that is why we consider `one <= 0` and append pair to our final answer. Same logic is for `one >= 0`. In this way for non-empty prefixes/suffixes we will deal with them only once and for empty we deal with them twice as it should be.
 3. In the end we remove duplicates: return set.

#### Complexity
For each word we make `O(k^2)` preprocessing, so in total we have `O(nk^2)` time for the first step. For the second step we traverse each element in values of `W_d` only once and we have no more than `O(n^2)` of them, so total time complexity is `O(nk^2 + n^2)`. Space complexity is `O(n^2)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def palindromePairs(self, W):
        W_d, ans = defaultdict(list), []

        for idx, word in enumerate(W):
            W_d[word].append([0, idx])
            for i in range(1, len(word) + 1):
                suff, pref = word[:i], word[i:]
                if suff == suff[::-1]:
                    W_d[pref].append([- (pref != ""),idx])
                if pref == pref[::-1]:
                    W_d[suff].append([+ (suff != ""),idx])
                    
        for idx, word in enumerate(W):
            for one, two in W_d[word[::-1]]:
                if idx != two and one <= 0: 
                    ans.append((idx, two))
                if idx != two and one >= 0: 
                    ans.append((two, idx))
                    
        return set(ans)
