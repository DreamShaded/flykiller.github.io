tags: [hash table, string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-duplicate-file-in-system/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-duplicate-file-in-system/

#### Solution
When you understand what is asked, it is actually very easy: all you need to do is to use hash-table (defaultdict), where keys are content of files and values are list of path names. What we do we iterate `for path in paths`, then we split each `path`, using space, first part is the path of folder and for the other parts we split it again, using `(`. Then we add item to defaultdict. Finally, we iterate over our `ans` and choose only those elements, for which we have at least `2` duplicates.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(T + S)`, where `T` is total sum of all length of full path names and `S` is total length of all content of files. So we can say, this solution is linear.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, paths):
        ans = defaultdict(list)
        for path in paths:
            l = path.split()
            for i in range(1, len(l)):
                name, cont = l[i].split("(")
                ans[cont[:-1]].append(l[0] + "/" + name)
                
        return [i for i in ans.values() if len(i) > 1]
```
