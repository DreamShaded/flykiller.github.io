title: Leetcode 0446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence
tags: [dp, array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices-ii-subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices-ii-subsequence/

#### Solution
Let `dp[i][d]` denotes the number of arithmetic subsequences that ends with `A[i]` and its common difference is `d`. Then we can look at all `j < i` and check if we can continue subsequence ending with point `j`. Then difference is equal to `d = A[i] - A[j]` and we can update `dp[i][d] += (dp[j][d] + 1)`. Notice, that in this way we evaluate number of all possible arithmetic subsequences with length `>= 2`, so we just need to subtract `n(n-1)/2` from final number (be careful to evaluate sum for `dp[i]`, after we iterate over all `j`). 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n^2)` for double loop and to keep all dictionaries.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, A):
        total, n = 0, len(A)
        dp = [Counter() for item in A]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                dp[i][A[i] - A[j]] += (dp[j][A[i] - A[j]] + 1)      
            total += sum(dp[i].values())
          
        return total - (n-1)*n//2   
```
