tags: [hash table, 2d-array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lonely-pixel-i/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/lonely-pixel-i/

#### Solution
Just compute number of pixels in each row and in each column. Then traverse picture once again and check if we have black pixel and if number of pixels in row and column is equal to `1`. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn)`, space complexity is `O(m+n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findLonelyPixel(self, A):
        m, n, ans = len(A), len(A[0]), 0

        rows, cols = [0]*m, [0]*n

        for r, c in product(range(m), range(n)):
            rows[r] += (A[r][c] == "B")
            cols[c] += (A[r][c] == "B")

        for r, c in product(range(m), range(n)):
            ans += (rows[r] == 1) and (cols[c] == 1) and (A[r][c] == "B")

        return ans
```
