title: Leetcode 0541 Reverse String II
tags: [string, two pointers]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked, go with step `2k` and reverse groups of `k` elements. Note, that in python if we have `a = "0123456789"`, then `a[7:15] = "789"`, so we do not need to worry about the last reverse. 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s, k):
        s_list = list(s)
        for i in range(0, len(s), 2*k):
            s_list[i:i+k] = s_list[i:i+k][::-1]
        return "".join(s_list)
```
