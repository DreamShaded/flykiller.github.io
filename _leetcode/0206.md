tags: [linked list, two pointers]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

#### Solution
The idea is to keep `2` pointers for current and next node and then iterate through nodes and reconnect nodes. The best way to understand this solution is to take some small list, for example `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None` and see what is going on on the each step.

1. In the beginning `curr = None, nxt = 1`.
2. On the first step we have: `tmp = 2`, `nxt.next = None`, `curr = 1`, `nxt = 2`. So what we have is the following: `None <- 1  2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None`. That is we cut one link between `1` and `2` and create new link `1 -> None`.
3. On the next step we have `None <- 1 <- 2  3 -> 4 -> None` and so on.

Try to draw it on the paper, step by step, it is the best way to feel it.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head):
        curr = None
        nxt = head
        while nxt:
            tmp = nxt.next
            nxt.next = curr
            curr = nxt
            nxt = tmp
            
        return curr
```
