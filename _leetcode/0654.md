#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-tree/

#### Solution
Straightforward solution is to use recursion: just do what is asked.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(nh)`, space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def constructMaximumBinaryTree(self, nums):
        if not nums: return None
        idx = nums.index(max(nums))
        root = TreeNode(nums[idx])
        root.left = self.constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums[:idx])
        root.right = self.constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums[idx+1:])
        return root
```

#### Solution 2
Actually, what is asked to construct is Cartesian tree. There is also smart solution, using decreasing stack with `O(n)` time/space complexity - the idea is that for each element `num` its left children is the biggest element to the left, smaller than `num` and its right children is the biggest element to the right, smaller than `num`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def constructMaximumBinaryTree(self, nums):
        stack = [TreeNode(float('inf'))]
        for num in nums:
            node = TreeNode(num)
            while stack[-1].val < num:
                node.left = stack.pop()
            stack[-1].right = node
            stack.append(node)
        return stack[0].right
```

#### Remark
Another solution is to use BIT or segment tree to quick access to maximum in range with complexity `O(n log n)`.
