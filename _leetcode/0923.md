title: Leetcode 0923. 3Sum With Multiplicity

Let us calculate `Counter(arr)`, that is how what is frequency of each number and then check `3` cases:
1. All numbers `i < j < k` ar different: then we can check all possible permutations for numbers `i` and `j` and then check that for `k = target - i - j` we have `i < j < k`.
2. For numbers `i, j, k` we have `i = j != k`. Then we have `c[i]*(c[i]-1)*c[target - 2*i]//2` number of options. Why? Because we need to choose `i` element twice, this is number of combinations with `2` elements from `c[i]` elements. Note, that I did not specify which of three indexes here is smaller and which is bigger, so here we cover all cases where exactly `2` indexes are equal.
3. For numers `i, j, k` we have `i = j = k`. Here answer is `c[i]*(c[i]-1)*(c[i]-2)//6`: number of combinations with `3` elements from `c[i]` elements.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is length of `arr`, because on first iteration we did `O(n^2)` and on second and third we did `O(n)`. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumMulti(self, arr, target):
        c = Counter(arr)
        ans, M = 0, 10**9 + 7
        for i, j in permutations(c, 2):
            if i < j < target - i - j:
                ans += c[i]*c[j]*c[target - i - j]

        for i in c:
            if 3*i != target:
                ans += c[i]*(c[i]-1)*c[target - 2*i]//2
            else:
                ans += c[i]*(c[i]-1)*(c[i]-2)//6
                
        return ans % M
```
