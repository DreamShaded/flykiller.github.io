#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-good-base/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-good-base/

#### Solution
We are actually asked to find the smallest `a` such that for some natural `k`: `1 + a + ... + a^k = n`. It is equivalent to finding the maximum `k`, which is less than `log_2(n)`. So, we start with `k` equal to integer part of `log_2(n)` and decrease it and try to solve equation of `a`: `1 + a + ... + a^k = n`. We can solve this equation either using **binary search** or we can note, that `a < n^{1/k} < a+1` for `k >= 2`, so the only candidate we have for `a` is `[n^{1/k}]` (and we need to handle case `k = 1` separately).

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def smallestGoodBase(self, n):
        n = int(n)
        max_k = int(log(n, 2))
        for k in range(max_k,1,-1):
            a = int(n**(1/k))
            if (a**(k + 1) - 1)//(a - 1) == n:
                return str(a)
        return str(n - 1) 
```
