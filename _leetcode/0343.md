title: Leetcode 0343. Integer Break
tags: [math, dp]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/

#### Solution
We can do it with dp way, where `dp[i]` is the answer for number `i`. Then to evaluate it, we need to check for every `1 <= j < i`:
`j *(i-j)` and `j * dp[i-j]`. Complexity will be `O(n^2)` if we make assumption that multiplication is done in `O(1)`.

We can note that actually all factors should be `2` or `3`, for example if we have `4`, we split it into `2, 2`, if it is `5`, we split into `2, 3` and so on. 

#### Complexity
In this way time and space complexity  is `O(n)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n):
        def dp(n):
            return n if n < 5 else dp(n-3)*3
        
        if n <= 3: return n - 1
        if n == 4: return n
        return dp(n)
```

#### Remark
See similar **1808**. Maximize Number of Nice Divisors problem.
