tags: [2d-array]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/magic-squares-in-grid/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/magic-squares-in-grid/

#### Solution
Just check every possible `3x3` squares: there will be `O(mn)` of them. We need to evaluate sums of rows, columns, diagonals and check that we have numbers from `1` to `9`. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(9mn)`, space is `O(9)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numMagicSquaresInside(self, grid):
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        ans = 0
        for i in range(0, m-2):
            for j in range(0, n-2):
                matrix = [grid[q][j:j+3] for q in range(i,i+3)]
                elements = set(chain(*matrix))
                cols = [sum(i) for i in zip(*matrix)]
                rows = [sum(i) for i in matrix]
                d1 = [sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(3))]
                d2 = [sum(matrix[i][2-i] for i in range(3))]
                if len(set(cols + rows + d1 + d2)) == 1 and elements == set(range(1,10)):
                    ans += 1
                    
        return ans
```
