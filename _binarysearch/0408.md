#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Island-Shape-Perimeter/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Island-Shape-Perimeter/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0463. Island Perimeter.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, grid):
        m, n, Perimeter = len(grid), len(grid[0]), 0

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                Perimeter += 4*grid[i][j]
                if i > 0:   Perimeter -= grid[i][j]*grid[i-1][j]
                if i < m-1: Perimeter -= grid[i][j]*grid[i+1][j]
                if j > 0:   Perimeter -= grid[i][j]*grid[i][j-1]
                if j < n-1: Perimeter -= grid[i][j]*grid[i][j+1]
                    
        return Perimeter
```
