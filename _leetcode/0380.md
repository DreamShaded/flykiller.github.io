title: Leetcode 0380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)
tags: []
---

My idea for this problem to achieve `O(1)` complexity for all three operation is to use 2 dictionaries: I called them direct dictionary `dic_direct` and inverse dictionary `dic_invert`.
1. In direct dictionary we keep indexes and corresponding values: for example: `0:3`, `1:4`, `2:1` means, that we have `3` values in our dictionary: `[3,4,1]`.
2. In invert dictionary we keep the opposite correspondences: `3:0`, `4:1`, `1:2`. Why we need to keep two dictionaries? Because we want to search quickly both by keys and by values.
3. `num_elem` is to count number of elements in our set (you can avoid it, but code becomes a bit more readible).

**Insert**. When we do insert, we first check if element is already in our invert dictionary, because we are looking for value. We do it in `O(1)`. If element is not here, we just add it to the "end" of our dictionaries, by this I mean, we add it with biggest existing index in dicionary, increased by `1`. For example if we want to add new element `10` into  `0:3`, `1:4`, `2:1`, then we have  `0:3`, `1:4`, `2:1`, `3:10`.

**Remove:** this one is a bit more complicated. Imagine, that we want to remove element `4` from `0:3`, `1:4`, `2:1`, `3:10`. What we need to do in this case? We find it and delete first, but now we have **gap** in our indexes: `0:3`, `2:1`, `3:10`. We can easily fix it, let us take the last element and put it into our gap, so we have `0:3`, `1:10`, `2:1` now. If we do not have **gap**, that is we removed the last element, then we do not need to do this action. In any case we have `O(1)` complexity.

**getRandom** This one is easy, we just generate random number, uniformly distributed between `0` and `1`, multiply it by number of all elements in set and evaluate `floor` function. For example if we have 5 elements, and we generated number `0.7`, then we need to choose element number `3`. Complexity is `O(1)`.

```
class RandomizedSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dic_direct = {}
        self.dic_invert = {}
        self.num_elem = 0
        
    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if val in self.dic_invert:
            return False
        else:
            self.dic_invert[val] = self.num_elem
            self.dic_direct[self.num_elem] = val
            self.num_elem += 1
            return True
        
    def remove(self, val):
        if val not in self.dic_invert:
            return False
        else:
            ind = self.dic_invert.pop(val)
            self.dic_direct.pop(ind)
            if ind != self.num_elem - 1:
                self.dic_direct[ind] = self.dic_direct[self.num_elem - 1]
                self.dic_invert[self.dic_direct[self.num_elem - 1]] = ind
                self.dic_direct.pop(self.num_elem - 1)
            self.num_elem -= 1
            return True
        
    def getRandom(self):
        index = floor(random.random()*self.num_elem)
        return self.dic_direct[index]
```
