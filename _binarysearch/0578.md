#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Paying-Workers-With-Coins/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Paying-Workers-With-Coins/

#### Solution
Start with the biggest salary, imagine that we have `x` options for it. Then for the second biggest salary if we have `y` coins which good values, than we have `y - 1` options and so on. In the end we multiply all these numbers.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n + m log m + m log n)` for time, where `n = len(C)` and `m = len(S)`. Space is `O(m + n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, C, S):
        S, C, ans = sorted(S), sorted(C), 1
        for i, sal in enumerate(S[::-1]):
            idx = len(C) - bisect.bisect_left(C, sal)
            ans = (ans * (idx - i)) % (10**9 + 7)
        return ans
```
