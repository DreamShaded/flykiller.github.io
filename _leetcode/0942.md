tags: [greedy, two pointers, math]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/di-string-match/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/di-string-match/

#### Solution
We can use greedy strategy here: if we have `I`, we can add smallest element, if we have `D`, we add biggest element. In this way we always can be sure that conditions hold.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def diStringMatch(self, s):
        beg, end, ans = 0, len(s), []
        for x in s:
            if x == "I":
                ans += [beg]
                beg += 1
            else:
                ans += [end]
                end -= 1
                
        return ans + [beg]
```
