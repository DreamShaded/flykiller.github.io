#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-return-to-origin/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-return-to-origin/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked, simulate the process.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def judgeCircle(self, moves):
        x, y = 0, 0
        for s in moves:
            if s == "R": x += 1
            elif s == "L": x -= 1
            elif s == "U": y += 1
            else: y -= 1
        return x == 0 and y == 0
```
