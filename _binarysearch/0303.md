<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Bomber-Man/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Bomber-Man/

#### Solution
Find number of full zero rows and multiply it by number of full zero columns.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, M):
        m, n = len(M), len(M[0])
        r = sum(all(i == 0 for i in row) for row in M)
        c = sum(all(i == 0 for i in col) for col in zip(*M))
        return r * c
```
