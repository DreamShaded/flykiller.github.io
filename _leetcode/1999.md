title: Leetcode 1999 Smallest Greater Multiple Made of Two Digits
tags: [math, queue]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-greater-multiple-made-of-two-digits/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-greater-multiple-made-of-two-digits/

#### Solution
One of the ways to solve this problem is to use queue, where each time we extract number `x` and add numbers `x*10 + d1` and `x*10 + d2`. Be careful to add only bigger number then we have, for example if `x = 0` and `d1 = 0`, we do not add `0` again. First time when we have number divisible by `k`, we return it. If we did not found it, return `-1`

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(2^m)`, where `m` is maximum number of digits we can have. Space complexity is the same.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findInteger(self, k, d1, d2):
        q = deque([0])
        cands = sorted(set([d1, d2]))
        
        while q:
            num = q.popleft()
            if num > k and num % k == 0: return num
            if num >= 2**31: return -1
            for cand in cands:
                if num*10 + cand != num:
                    q.append(num*10 + cand)
                    
        return -1
```
