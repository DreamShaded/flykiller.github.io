#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Furthest-From-Origin/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Furthest-From-Origin/

#### Solution
The idea is that we can replace all ? with either L or R and consider this border cases.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        L = s.count("L")
        R = s.count("R")
        Q = s.count("?")
        return max(L - R + Q, L - R - Q, R - L + Q, R - L - Q)
```
