#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Count-of-Sublists-with-Same-First-and-Last-Values/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Count-of-Sublists-with-Same-First-and-Last-Values/

#### Solution
For each value `x` if we have `t` places, we can get `t * (t + 1)//2` segments.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        return sum(x*(x+1)//2 for x in Counter(nums).values())
```
