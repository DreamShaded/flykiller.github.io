title: Leetcode 1612 Check If Two Expression Trees are Equivalent
tags: [hash table, tree, counter, dfs]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-two-expression-trees-are-equivalent/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-two-expression-trees-are-equivalent/

#### Solution
Traverse trees and count number of times we meet each symbol. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(26n + 26m)`, where `n` and `m` are sizes of our trees. Space complexity is `O(26*max(h1, h2))`, where `h1` and `h2` are heights of our trees.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkEquivalence(self, root1, root2):
        def dfs(node):
            if node.val != "+": return Counter(node.val)
            return dfs(node.left) + dfs(node.right)
        
        return dfs(root1) == dfs(root2)   
```
