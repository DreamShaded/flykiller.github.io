#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rle-iterator/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/rle-iterator/

#### Solution
Basically, what we need to do is to iterate over our data and keep tuples `(frequency, number)`. Let put them to stack. Then we need to do:
1. If stack is not empty and `n > self.stack[-1][0]`, it means, that we can remove last element from stack completely and update `n`.
2. If stack is empty now, return `-1` immediately.
3. Extract last `freq, num` from stack and put updated frequency. Note, that `freq - n >= 0`, because in the opposite case we already managed it in while loop.
4. Finally, return `num`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(N + Q)`, where `N` is size of `A` and `Q` is number of `next` runs.

#### Code
```python
class RLEIterator:
    def __init__(self, A):
        self.stack = [(A[2*i], A[2*i+1]) for i in range(len(A)//2 - 1, -1, -1)]

    def next(self, n):
        while self.stack and n > self.stack[-1][0]:
            n -= self.stack[-1][0]
            self.stack.pop()
            
        if not self.stack: return -1
        
        freq, num = self.stack.pop()     
        self.stack.append((freq-n, num))
        
        return num
```
