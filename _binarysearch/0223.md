#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Reverse-Graph/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Reverse-Graph/

#### Solution
Just do what is asked: traverse edges and add opposite edge in `G2`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(E)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, G):
        n = len(G)
        G2 = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in G[i]:
                G2[j] += [i]

        return [sorted(G2[i]) for i in range(n)]
```
