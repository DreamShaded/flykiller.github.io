#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-in-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-in-string/

#### Solution
Let us create dictionary `d`, where for each `i` we correspond it to `S[i]`. Then we iterate through `zip(indexes, sources, targets)` and if we have match, we change values in `d`: make `d[i] = targ` and make all others empty. In this way we can be sure that we store the original indexes.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(S + T)`, where `S` is total lenght of `sources` and `T` is total lenght of `targets`. Space complexity is `O(T + n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findReplaceString(self, S, indexes, sources, targets):
        d = {i:S[i] for i in range(len(S))}
        for i, sour, targ in zip(indexes, sources, targets):
            if S[i:i+len(sour)] == sour:
                d[i] = targ
                for j in range(i+1, i + len(sour)): d[j] = ""

        return "".join(d[i] for i in range(len(S)))
```
