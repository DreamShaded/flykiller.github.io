#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-ii/

#### Solution 1
There is `O(n^2)` solution with the following idea: let `self.one` be sorted list with intervals, which are visited once and `self.two` intervals visited twice. Then when we have new interval, we:

1. Check if this interval have intersections with `self.two` list. If it has, we immediately return `False`.
2. Next, we find place, where our interval is intersecting with `self.one` list. First of all, this interval is not intersecting with `self.two`, in opposite case we already should have returned False. So,  we just need to insert in right place part of `self.one` list. Note also, that depending on parity of start and end, we either add it or not (see Problem **0715** Range Module for similar trick).
3. Also, we need to fix `self.one`: remove all elements, which are now covered twice and again use trick with ends.
\end{itemize}

#### Complexity
Overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class MyCalendarTwo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.one = []  # intervals that are booked once
        self.two = []  # intervals that are booked twice
        
    def book(self, start, end):
        if (t := bisect.bisect_right(self.two, start)) % 2: return False
        if t != bisect.bisect_left(self.two, end): return False
        
        i = bisect.bisect_right(self.one, start)
        j = bisect.bisect_left(self.one, end)
        
        self.two[t:t] = [start]*(i%2) + self.one[i:j] + [end]*(j%2)
        self.one[i:j] = [start]*((i+1)%2) + [end]*((j+1)%2)
                
        return True 
```

#### Solution 2
There is also `O(n log n)` algorithm (which in practice works more or less the same): we use Sorted Lists instead of usual lists: then each element will be added and removed from each sorted list `O(1)` times (to check)

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class MyCalendarTwo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.one = SortedList()  # intervals that are booked once
        self.two = SortedList()  # intervals that are booked twice
        
    def book(self, start, end):
        if (t := SortedList.bisect_right(self.two, start)) % 2: return False
        if t != SortedList.bisect_left(self.two, end): return False
        
        i = SortedList.bisect_right(self.one, start)
        j = SortedList.bisect_left(self.one, end)
        
        for item in [start]*(i%2) + self.one[i:j] + [end]*(j%2): self.two.add(item)
        for _ in range(j-i): del self.one[i]
        for item in  [start]*((i+1)%2) + [end]*((j+1)%2): self.one.add(item)
                
        return True 
```

#### Remark
Notice that there is also segment tree solution, where we use sparse segment tree with complexity `O(n log M)`, where `M = 10**9`.
