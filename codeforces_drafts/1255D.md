The idea is to fill our grid by snake, in this way we can be sure that any part is connected. Time and space complexity is `O(rc)`.

```python
T = int(input())
for u in range(T):
    r, c, k = map(int, input().split())
    grid = []
    food = 0
    for _ in range(r):
        line = input()
        grid += [[i for i in line]]
        food += line.count("R")

    chickens = [food//k] * k
    for i in range(food % k):
        chickens[i] += 1

    path = []
    for i in range(r):
        dr = 1 if i % 2 == 0 else -1
        for j in range(c)[::dr]:
            path.append((i, j))

    al = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"
    ind = 0

    for y, x in path:
        save = grid[y][x]
        grid[y][x] = al[ind]
        if save == "R": chickens[ind] -= 1
        if chickens[ind] == 0 and ind < len(chickens) - 1: ind += 1
           
    for line in grid:
        print("".join(line))
```
