tags: [dfs, backtracking, dp]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-subsequences/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-subsequences/

#### Solution
One solution is to use dynamic programming, where in `dp[i]` we keep all sequences, which stops with element number `i`. In the end we need to select only sequences with length more than `1` and remove duplicates.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is potentially `O(2^n)` for non-decreasing sequence and space complexity is `O(n * 2^n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findSubsequences(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [[[nums[i]]] for i in range(n)]
        for j, k in combinations(range(n), 2):
            if nums[j] <= nums[k]:
                for sols in dp[j]:
                    dp[k].append(sols + [nums[k]])
                        
        q = list(chain(*dp))
        return [list(s) for s in set(tuple(s) for s in q if len(s) > 1)]
```

#### Remark
There is another classical dfs+backtracking solution, where we use `dfs(last, path)` function, where `last` is the last taken index and `path` is sequence constructed so far. However we still need to check for duplicates.
