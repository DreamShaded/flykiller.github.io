#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/path-in-zigzag-labelled-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/path-in-zigzag-labelled-binary-tree/

#### Solution
First of all notice, that we will have ranges `[1, 2), [2, 4), [4, 8), [8, 16)` and so on in our layers. Let us look at say number `13`, what its parent? First of all we need to find symmetric element in this row, which is `10` and then just use `x -> x//2`. How to find symmetric element? Sum of two symmetric elements is `3*2^x - 1`, where `x` is the smallest value in this row.

#### Complexity
It is `O(log n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def pathInZigZagTree(self, label):
        x = label.bit_length() - 1
        ans = [label]
        for i in range(x, 0, -1):
            label = (1<<i) * 3 - 1 - label
            label //= 2
            ans += [label]
        return ans[::-1]
```
