tags: [graph, union find, connected components]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/the-earliest-moment-when-everyone-become-friends/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/the-earliest-moment-when-everyone-become-friends/

#### Solution
This is classical union find problem, where we need to traverse our graph and add edge by edge. If we have one component with all elements, return this time.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(N log N + M)`, where `M = len(logs)`. Space complexity is `O(N)`.

#### Code
```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self, N):
        self.p = list(range(N))

    def find(self, x):
        if self.p[x] != x:
            self.p[x] = self.find(self.p[x])
        return self.p[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        xr = self.find(x)
        yr = self.find(y)
        self.p[xr] = yr

class Solution:
    def earliestAcq(self, logs, N):
        dsu = DSU(N)
        comps = N
        for time, x, y in sorted(logs):
            if dsu.find(x) != dsu.find(y):
                comps -= 1
                dsu.union(x, y)

            if comps == 1: return time

        return -1
```
