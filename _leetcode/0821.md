What we need to do in this problem is to iterate our data two times: one time from left to right and second time from right to left. Let us use auxilary function `letter_get(letter, dr)`, where `dr` is direction: `+1` for left->right traversal and `-1` for right -> left traversal.

How this function will work? We initialize it with zeroes first and we keep `cur` value, which represents the last place where we meet symbol `letter`. We traverse string, check each symbol and if it is equal to `letter`, we update `cur` place. We put `abs(i - cur)` to result: this is distance between current place and last place where we meet symbol `letter`.

Finally, we apply our function twice for two directions and choose the smallest distance. Note also that we initialized `curr = -n`, because in this case we will have distances `>=n` for symbols for places, where we do not have elements equal to `letter` before, and this value is bigger than all possible values in answer, so it works as infinity here.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(n)` as well.

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestToChar(self, S, C):
        def letter_get(letter, dr):
            n = len(S)
            res, cur = [0]*n, -n
            for i in range(n)[::dr]:
                if S[i] == letter: cur = i
                res[i] = abs(i - cur)
            return res
        
        return [min(x,y) for x,y in zip(letter_get(C, 1), letter_get(C, -1))]
```
