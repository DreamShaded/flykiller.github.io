#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/change-the-root-of-a-binary-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/change-the-root-of-a-binary-tree/

#### Solution
This is type of tree problems where you need to reconstruct tree following given rules. Usualy recursion (dfs) if useful. The idea is to traverse from `root` to `leaf` and do what we need on each step:

1. Create new connection between `node` and its `child`: we need to know which child to delete.
2. If we reached `root`, return `node`.
3. Finally we need to reconnect children and run function recursively.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(h)`.

#### Code
```python
# borrowed code
class Solution:
    def flipBinaryTree(self, root, leaf):
        def dfs(node, child):
            p = node.parent
            node.parent = child
            if node.left == child: node.left = None
            if node.right == child: node.right = None
                
            if node == root:
                return node
            
            if node.left: node.right = node.left
            node.left = dfs(p, node)
            return node
        
        return dfs(leaf, None)
```
