#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Shortest-Majority-Substring/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Shortest-Majority-Substring/

#### Solution
In fact, answer can be `-1`, `2` or `3`. Imagine, that we have string with length `> 3`. Then we can remove some symbols from the start and from the end, which is not equal to the most frequent symbol, so we have `x....x`. If we have `x...xx`, then we have answer of length `2`, in the opposite case we can remove last two symbols and have shorter string.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == s[i + 1]: return 2
        for i in range(n - 2):
            if s[i] == s[i + 2]: return 3
        return -1
```
