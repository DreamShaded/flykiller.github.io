#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/index-pairs-of-a-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/index-pairs-of-a-string/

#### Solution
One way to solve this problem is just to check all substrings of `text` and check if we have them in our words

#### Complexity
It is `O(n^3)` for time and `O(M)` for space where `M` is total length of words in `words`.

#### Remark
Another solution is for each wor to check all possible places with complexity `O(M*n)`.

Finally, there is trie solution, where we can put all words to trie in `O(M)` time and then we start with every one of `n` elements in `text` and traverse our tree: total complexity will be `O(M + n*k)`, where `k` is the longest word.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def indexPairs(self, text, words):
        words_set, ans = set(words), []
        for i, j in combinations(range(len(text) + 1), 2):
            if text[i:j] in words_set:
                ans += [[i, j-1]]
                
        return ans
```
