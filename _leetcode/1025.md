#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/

#### Solution
One way to solve is to use dp. However this problem can solved easier: if number is even, we can always make it odd, subtracting `1`. If number is odd, all divisors are odd and it must be even on the next steps. So, odd values are **winning** positions and even values are **loosing** positions.

#### Complexity
It is `O(1)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def divisorGame(self, n):
        return not n%2
```
