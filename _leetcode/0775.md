#### Problem statement
<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/global-and-local-inversions/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/global-and-local-inversions/

#### Solution
One way to solve it is to just find all number of permutations either in `O(n^2)` bruteforce  or `O(n * log n)` using merge sort or Sorted List.

However here we do not need to do it and we can solve it in `O(n)` time. Let us keep `level`, this is maximum among first `i-1` values. If we consider `i+1`-th number, than it need to be greater than `level` to return True. Indeed, if it is not the case, than we have at least one inversion which is not local, with gap `2` or more. So if at any moment this condition do not hold, we return `False` and finish our program.

From the other point of view, if at each step we have `A[i+1] > max(A[0], A[1], ... A[i-1])`, it means that we can not have not-local inversions: for each two indexes `j` and `k`, such that `j >= k + 2`, we get `A[j] > A[k]`, which is exaclty definition of not-local inversion.

So, what we checked here is that our condition is **sufficient** and **enough** to check that number of global inversions is equal to number of local inverstions.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n)$ as we discussed, space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(1)$.

#### Code

```pyton
class Solution:
    def isIdealPermutation(self, A):
        level = -float("inf")
        n = len(A)
        for i in range(1, n):
            if A[i] < level: 
                return False
            else:
                level = max(level, A[i-1])
                
        return True
```

#### Remark
We can also notice that we could only place `i` at `A[i-1], A[i]` or `A[i+1]` and check it again in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time.
