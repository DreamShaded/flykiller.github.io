#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-two-valid-parentheses-strings/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-two-valid-parentheses-strings/

#### Solution
Let us go brackets by bracket and keep balance of two substrings. Each time we will add to the string which have smaller balance and remove from the string with larger balance.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepthAfterSplit(self, s):
        bal1, bal2, ans = 0, 0, []
        for x in s:
            if x == "(":
                if bal1 < bal2:
                    ans += [0]
                    bal1 += 1
                else:
                    ans += [1]
                    bal2 += 1
            else:
                if bal1 < bal2:
                    ans += [1]
                    bal2 -= 1
                else:
                    ans += [0]
                    bal1 -= 1                
        return ans
```
