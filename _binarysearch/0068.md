tags: [counter, anagram]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Anagram-Subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Anagram-Subsequence/

#### Solution
Create counter for each string, then find intersection and return sum of frequencies.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m+n)` for time and `O(26)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, a, b):
        return sum((Counter(a) & Counter(b)).values())
```
