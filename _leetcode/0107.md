Not the most optimal way, but for me the most intuitive is to use **bfs** traversal of our graph, put all information into some auxilary list, and then traverse this list and reconstruct output.  Let us consider the following example in more details:

1. `Out_temp` is temporary list with pairs: first element in pair is value of node and the second is level of this node. We use **bfs** with queue to traverse our tree and in the end we have
`Out_temp = [[3, 0], [9, 1], [20, 1], [15, 2], [7, 2]]`.
2. The second step is to reconstruct level by level `Out` list: we traverse our `Out_temp` and if level of new element is not the same as previous, we create new sublist.

**Complexity** is `O(V)`, where `V` is number of nodes in our tree, because we use bfs traversal and then we have one more `O(V)` postprosessing of our data. Space complexity is also `O(V)`.


```python
class Solution:
    def levelOrderBottom(self, root):
        if not root: return []
    
        Out_temp, deq = [], deque([[root, 0]])
    
        while deq:
            elem = deq.popleft()
            Out_temp.append([elem[0].val, elem[1]])
            if elem[0].left:
                deq.append([elem[0].left, elem[1] + 1])
            if elem[0].right:
                deq.append([elem[0].right, elem[1] + 1])

        Out = [[Out_temp[0][0]]]
        for i in range(1, len(Out_temp)):
            if Out_temp[i][1] == Out_temp[i-1][1]:
                Out[Out_temp[i][1]].append(Out_temp[i][0])
            else:
                Out.append([Out_temp[i][0]])

        return Out[::-1]
```
