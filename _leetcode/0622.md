#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-queue/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-queue/

#### Solution

The idea here is to use list of size `k` and modulo arithmetic. Let `self.CircQueue` be this list, fill it with `-1` in the beginning and also keep two values `self.front` which  points one element after front element and `self.end` which points at the end element. For example when we have `[-1, -1, 2, 3, 4, -1` elements in our list, it means that `self.end = 2` and `self.front = 5`. Let us go through operations quickly:

1.`enQueue`: first check if our data structure is full and if it is return `False`. In opposite case decrease `self.end` and put new element.

2.`deQueue`: first check if our data structure is empty and if it is return `False`. In opposite case decrease `self.front` and remove one element, that is make it equal to `-1`.

3.`Front` is similar to `deQueue`, but just return one element before `front`.

4.`Rear` is similar to `enQueue`, but just return element with index `end`.

5.`isEmpty` just check if `front` is equal to `end`.

6.`isFull` just check that in total we have `k` elements: `end - front`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of all operations is `O(1)`. Space complexity of total data structure is `O(k)`.

#### Code
```python
class MyCircularQueue:
    def __init__(self, k):
        self.CircQueue = [-1]*k
        self.k, self.front, self.end = k, 0, 0
        
    def enQueue(self, value):
        if self.isFull(): return False
        self.end -= 1
        self.CircQueue[self.end % self.k] = value
        return True

    def deQueue(self):
        if self.isEmpty(): return False
        self.front -= 1
        self.CircQueue[self.front % self.k] = -1
        return True

    def Front(self):
        if self.isEmpty(): return -1
        return self.CircQueue[(self.front - 1) % self.k]     

    def Rear(self):
        if self.isEmpty(): return -1
        return self.CircQueue[self.end % self.k]      

    def isEmpty(self):
        return self.front == self.end
        
    def isFull(self):
        return self.front - self.end == self.k
```
