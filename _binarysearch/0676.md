#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Connect-Sticks/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Connect-Sticks/

#### Solution
Let us keep state `(mask, last)`, where `mask` is bitmask for not used sticks yet and `last` is the end of the last stick. Then given mask and last we can try to find all candidates.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(2^n*m^2)` for time and `O(2^n*m)` for space, where `n = len(S)` and `m = 6` here.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, S):
        n = len(S)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(mask, last):
            ans = 0
            for i, (x, y) in enumerate(S):
                for b, e in (x, y), (y, x):
                    if e == last and mask >> i & 1:
                        ans = max(ans, dp(mask^(1<<i), b) + 1)
            return ans

        return max(dp((1<<n) - 1, x) for x in range(1, 7))
```
