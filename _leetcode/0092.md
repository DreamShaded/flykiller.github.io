#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/

#### Solution
Very similar to problem **25**. We keep three pointers as with any other reverse linked lists problems: `pre, curr, next`. We can split all algorithm into `3` steps:

1. Do `m-1` steps to reach the first point of range we need to reverse.
2. Reverse range `[n - m]`, using 3 pointers approach.
3. Finally we need to fix connections for the start and for the end of reversed list, using saved pointer to `pre` element.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, because we need to traverse elements upto `n`-th. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head, m, n):
        if m == n: return head
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        pre = dummy
        for i in range(m-1):
            pre = pre.next
            
        curr = pre.next
        nxt = curr.next
        
        for i in range(n-m):
            tmp = nxt.next
            nxt.next = curr
            curr = nxt
            nxt = tmp
            
        pre.next.next = nxt
        pre.next = curr
        return dummy.next
```
