#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-th-smallest-pair-distance/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-th-smallest-pair-distance/

#### Solution
Let us ask a question: given sorted list of numbers, how many pairs we have, such that their difference `<= x`, where `x` some given number. We can solve this question, using BS in `O(n log n)`, but actually we can use two pointers approach to solve it in `O(n)`. Then we do binary search in range `[0, M]`, where `M` is the biggest number, asking question: how many pairs with difference `<= x` we have.

#### Complexity
Overall complexity is `O(n log n + n log M)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums, k):
        def helper(x):
            count, left = 0, 0
            for right, num in enumerate(nums):
                while num - nums[left] > x:
                    left += 1
                count += right - left
            return count >= k

        nums.sort()
        beg, end = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end) // 2
            if helper(mid):
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid + 1

        return beg
```
