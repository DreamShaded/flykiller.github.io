tags: [tree, hash table, dfs, bfs]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-vertical-order-traversal/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-vertical-order-traversal/

#### Solution
Almost the same as Problem **0987**. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree. The difference here is the order in which we need to give nodes if they have the same coordinates. For each vertical layer we need to sort them by horizontal coordinate and about values, keep them like this. Note, that in Problem **0987**, we sorted by `key = lambda x: (x[0], x[1])`, and we can not do it here, if we have the same `x[0]`, we need to keep order from left to right (as it is already, because we consturcted it in this way), not from smallest to biggest

#### Complexity
It can be estimated similarly to **0987** as $O(n\log w)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def verticalOrder(self, root):
        dic = defaultdict(list)
        self.min_l, self.max_l = float("inf"), -float("inf")
        def dfs(root, lvl_h, lvl_v):
            self.min_l = min(lvl_h, self.min_l)
            self.max_l = max(lvl_h, self.max_l)
            dic[lvl_h].append((lvl_v, root.val))
            if root.left:  dfs(root.left,  lvl_h-1, lvl_v+1)
            if root.right: dfs(root.right, lvl_h+1, lvl_v+1)
        
        if not root: return []
        dfs(root, 0, 0)
        
        out = []
        for i in range(self.min_l, self.max_l + 1):
            out += [[j for i,j in sorted(dic[i], key=lambda x:x[0])]]
        return out
```

#### Remark
There is also bfs solution, where we can avoid sorting with $O(n)$ time complexity.
