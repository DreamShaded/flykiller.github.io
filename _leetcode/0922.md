tags: [two pointers]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity-ii/

#### Solution
If we want to have `O(1)` space complexity solution, we need to use two pointers approach.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sortArrayByParityII(self, nums):
        i, j, n = 0, 1, len(nums)
        while j < n and i < n:
            if nums[i] % 2 == 0:
                i += 2
            elif nums[j] % 2 == 1:
                j += 2
            else:
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
        return nums
```
