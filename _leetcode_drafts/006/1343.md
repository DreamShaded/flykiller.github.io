#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sub-arrays-of-size-k-and-average-greater-than-or-equal-to-threshold/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sub-arrays-of-size-k-and-average-greater-than-or-equal-to-threshold/

#### Solution
Just use accumulate, then we can calculate sums in all `n - k + 1` subarrays of size `k` fast.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numOfSubarrays(self, arr, k, threshold):
        acc = [0] + list(accumulate(arr))
        return sum(acc[i + k] - acc[i] >= threshold * k for i in range(len(arr) - k + 1))
```
