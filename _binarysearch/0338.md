#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Even-Sum-Path/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Longest-Even-Sum-Path/

#### Solution
Use dfs, where for each `node` we return two values: `e, o`: the longest path with even and with odd sums, going from this node down. Then depending on we have odd or even value of node we recalculate values and also update answer: wihch can be one of `3` types for `even` value:
1. Even sum path in the left part, even sum path in the right path
2. Odd sum path in the left part, odd sum path in the right path
3. Path which have only one part, that is we start from node and go down.

Similar logic is for `odd` value of node.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(h)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, root):
        self.ans = 0
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return (0, -float("inf"))
            e1, o1 = dfs(node.left)
            e2, o2 = dfs(node.right)
            if node.val % 2 == 0:
                e, o = max(e1, e2) + 1, max(o1, o2) + 1
                self.ans = max(self.ans, e1 + e2 + 1, o1 + o2 + 1, e)
            else:
                e, o = max(o1, o2) + 1, max(e1, e2) + 1
                self.ans = max(self.ans, e1 + o2 + 1, e2 + o1 + 1, e)
            
            return e, o

        dfs(root)
        return self.ans
```
