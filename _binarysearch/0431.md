#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Next-Closest-Odd-Digit-Number/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Next-Closest-Odd-Digit-Number/

#### Solution
Use math and greedy strategy. Find smaller and bigger closest numbers.
1. Find biggest prefix fully with odd digits. If we have something like `xxxx0...` or `xxxx`, where `xxxx` are digit numbers, then we need to find the biggest suffix of this prefix with `1`, like `135111` goes to `133999` and `1111` goes to `999`. If it is `xxxxy` wher `y >= 1`, just have `xxxx(y-1)9..9`.
2. For closest bigger number it is a bit easier: have just `xxxx(y+1)1..1`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m)` for time and space, where `m` is number of digits in `n`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        s = str(n)
        m = len(s)
        i = 0
        while int(s[i]) % 2 == 1:
            i += 1

        if i == len(s) or s[i] == "0":
            j = i - 1
            while j > 0 and s[j-1] == "1": j -= 1
            p0 = "9"*(m-1) if j == 0 else s[:j-1] + str(int(s[j-1])-2) + "9" * (m-j)
        else:
            p0 = s[:i] + str(int(s[i])-1) + "9" * (m-i-1)

        p1 = s[:i] + str(int(s[i])+1) + "1" * (m-i-1)

        c0, c1 = int(p0), int(p1)
        if n - c0 < c1 - n:
            return c0
        else:
            return c1
```
