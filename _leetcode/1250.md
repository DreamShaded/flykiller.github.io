tags: [math, array]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-it-is-a-good-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-it-is-a-good-array/

#### Solution
Actually what we need to check is that gcd of all numbers is equal to `1`.
 
#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)` if we assume that gcd is evaluated in `O(1)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isGoodArray(self, nums):
        return reduce(gcd, nums) == 1
```
