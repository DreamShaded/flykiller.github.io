#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/

#### Solution
The idea here is to use `dfs(board, empty, rows, cols, boxes)` function, where:
1. `board` is current board we have.
2. `empty` is list of empty cells.
3. `rows` is defaultict, where for each of `9` rows we have set of values we have in this row, similar logic for `cols` and `boxes`.
    
What we do in our dfs backtracking algorithm is to choose any empty cell, and then try to put some number in this cell from the numbers we did not have on the same row, column or box, and run dfs with new arguments:

1. We look at `row[r]`, `cols[c]` and `boxes[3*(r//3)+c//3]`, and remove this elements from `set("123456789")`
2. Make `board[r][c] = k`.
3. Add `k` to corresponding row, column and box.
4. Run `dfs` recursively and if we found solution, return `True`.
5. Delete `k` from corresponding row, column and box.

#### Complexity
Time complexity of one dfs step is `O(1)`, because we actually need to check row, column and box. However it is difficult to estimate overall complexity of algorithm - I think it is exponential at least. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:    
    def solveSudoku(self, board):
        def dfs(board, empty, rows, cols, boxes):
            if not empty: return True
            r, c = empty[-1]
            for k in set("123456789") - (rows[r]|cols[c]|boxes[3*(r//3)+c//3]):
                board[r][c] = k
                for dic in [rows[r], cols[c], boxes[3*(r//3)+c//3]]:
                    dic.add(k)
                if dfs(board, empty[:-1], rows, cols, boxes): return True
                board[r][c] = '.'
                for dic in [rows[r], cols[c], boxes[3*(r//3)+c//3]]:
                    dic.remove(k)

            return False
        
        cols, rows, boxes, empty = defaultdict(set), defaultdict(set), defaultdict(set), []
        for r, c in product(range(9), range(9)):
            if board[r][c] == ".":
                empty.append((r,c))
            else:
                for dic in [rows[r], cols[c], boxes[3*(r//3)+c//3]]:
                    dic.add(board[r][c])
               
        dfs(board, empty, rows, cols, boxes)
```
