title: Leetcode 0581. Shortest Unsorted Continuous Subarray
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0581/
---

The goal of this problem is to find two numbers `beg` and `end`, such that difference of them is as small as possible and also such that if we sort nums from `beg` to `end` we will have fully sorted data.
 
 Let `run_max` be running maximum of `nums`.

 What is the `end` pointer? It is the smallest value such that
 
 `max(nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[end]) <= nums[end + 1] <= nums[end + 2] <= ... <= nums[-1]`:
 
 first inequality holds, because after we sort data inside, we still need to be less than `nums[end + 1]`, and the rest inequalites are definition that data after `end` is already sorted.
 
 Now, let us start from the end of our data and move to the left, checking if condtion holds. While it holds, we decrease `end` by one. Then we check if we reached `0` and if we did, we can immedietly return `0`, because data is sorted. If not, we do similar logic, starting with beginning of our data and moving to the right.
 
 **Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, we iterate just several times through our data. Space complexity is also `O(n)`, which can also be reduced to `O(1)`, but in my opinion the solution becomes much less intuitive.
 
```python
class Solution:
    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums):
        nums = [-float("inf")] + nums + [float("inf")]
        run_max = list(accumulate(nums, max))
        run_min = list(accumulate(nums[::-1], min))[::-1]
        
        end, beg = len(nums) - 1, 0

        while nums[end-1] <= nums[end] and run_max[end-1] <= nums[end - 1]:
            end -= 1
            
        if end == 0: return 0
            
        while nums[beg+1] >= nums[beg] and run_min[beg+1] >= nums[beg + 1]:
            beg += 1
            
        return end - beg - 1
```
