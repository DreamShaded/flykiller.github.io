#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-arrive-at-destination/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-arrive-at-destination/

#### Solution
The idea of this problem is to use Dijkstra algorithm, but also we need to keep not only distances to nodes, but counts as well.

1. If we meet `candidate == dist[neib]`, it means we found one more way to reach node with minimal cost.
2. If `candidate < dist[neib]`, it means that we found better candidate, so we update distance and put `cnt[neib] = cnt[idx]`.

#### Complexity
It is `O((E+V) log V)` for time as classical Dijkstra and `O(E+V)` for space

```python
class Solution:
    def countPaths(self, n, roads):
        G = defaultdict(list)
        for x, y, w in roads:
            G[x].append((y, w))
            G[y].append((x, w))

        dist = [float('inf')] * n
        dist[0] = 0
        cnt = [0]*n
        cnt[0] = 1
        heap = [(0, 0)]

        while heap:
            (min_dist, idx) = heappop(heap)
            if idx == n-1: return cnt[idx] % (10**9 + 7)
            for neib, weight in G[idx]:
                cand = min_dist + weight
                if cand == dist[neib]:
                    cnt[neib] += cnt[idx]

                elif candidate < dist[neib]:
                    dist[neib] = cand
                    heappush(heap, (cand, neib))
                    cnt[neib] = cnt[idx]
```
