title: Leetcode 1170. Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character
tags: [sort, binary search, string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-strings-by-frequency-of-the-smallest-character/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-strings-by-frequency-of-the-smallest-character/

#### Solution
For each word we evaluate frequeny of smallest symbol, then sort all these values in `words`. For each element from `queries` use binary search.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n + m log n)`, where `n = len(words)` and `m = len(queries)`, space is `O(m + n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numSmallerByFrequency(self, queries, words):
        f = sorted(w.count(min(w)) for w in words)
        return [len(f) - bisect.bisect(f, q.count(min(q))) for q in queries]
```
