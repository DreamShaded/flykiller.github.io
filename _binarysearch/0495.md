#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-Sum-Subsequence/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-Sum-Subsequence/

#### Solution
Classical dp problem, where `dp[i]` means that we process elements upto `i` and take the last element.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2], dp[i - 3]) + nums[i]

        return min(dp[-3:])
```
