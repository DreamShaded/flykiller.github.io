#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/before-and-after-puzzle/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/before-and-after-puzzle/

#### Solution
This problem I can say is dual to problem **0410**. Split Array Largest Sum: there we need to minimize maximimum of sums in partition, here we need to maximize minimum of sums in partition. Again use function `check(Q)` which answer the question: if we take that in each part we need to have sum `>= Q`, is it possible to have at least `K+1` parts.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*log(Q))`, where `Q = sum(nums)//(K+1) + 1`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeSweetness(self, nums, K):
        def check(Q):
            acc, ans = 0, 0
            for num in nums + [0]:
                if acc < Q:
                    acc += num
                else:
                    acc = num
                    ans += 1
            return ans >= K + 1

        beg, end = 1, sum(nums)//(K+1) + 1
        while beg + 1 < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if not check(mid):
                end = mid
            else:
                beg = mid
        
        return beg
```
