#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-Difference-of-Extremes/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Minimum-Difference-of-Extremes/

#### Solution
We can sort numbers and then delete `0/3, 1/2, 2/1, 3/0` biggest/smallest numbers.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        A = sorted(A)
        n = len(A)
        if n <= 4: return 0
        return min(A[-1] - A[3], A[-2] - A[2], A[-3] - A[1], A[-4] - A[0])
```

#### Remark
We can do it in `O(n)` time as well.
