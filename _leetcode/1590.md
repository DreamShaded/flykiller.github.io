#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/make-sum-divisible-by-p/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/make-sum-divisible-by-p/

#### Solution
The idea is to use cumulative sums. We will keep in `last` the last index for cumulative sum being equal to specific number. Then when we meet cumulative sum `num`, we are looking for the last place of `num - k` before, where `k = sum(nums) % p`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(min(n, p))`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minSubarray(self, nums, p):
        k, n = sum(nums) % p, len(nums)
        ans, last = n, {0: -1}
        if k == 0: return 0
        for i, num in enumerate(accumulate(nums)):
            if (num - k) % p in last:
                ans = min(ans, i - last[(num - k)%p])
            last[num % p] = i

        return ans if ans != n else -1
```
