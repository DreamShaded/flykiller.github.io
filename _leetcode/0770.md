#### Problem statement

#### Solution
Very difficult and painful problem, there no chance that you solve it under 2 hours. Let us use the idea of **0772** Basic Calculator III combined with polynomial multiplication and addition. First of all, let us discuss how our polynomials will look like: list of tuples: `[(('a', 'a'), -1), (('a', 'b'), 0), (('b', 'b'), 1)]` in each tuple we have two elements: first one is tuple of variables and second is number - coefficient. For example we have `-a*a + b*b` polynomial here.

Now, we need to modify our `update` function from Basic Calculator III:

1. First, we check if we have list as our variable: if we have not list, it means that we just start to build our polynomial: so, we first check if this variable has value, using `v = values.get(v, v)` function. Then we check if we have number (it can start with `-`) and create polynomial `v = [((), int(v))]`. If it is variable, then we create variable `v = [((v,), 1)]`
2. If we have `+`, then we just append polynomial to stack
3. If we have `-`, we need to add to stack polynomial multiplied by `-1` (we write `-1` as `[((), -1)]`)
4. If we have `*`, then we need to pop last element of stack, multiply it by `v` and put it back.
5. The rest logic of `calculate` is very similar to Basic Calculator III, the only difference is instead of summating our stack, we apply `AddPol` function to all stack.
6. Finally we calculate our string, remove all terms with value `0`, sort items by length and order and finally join all string.

#### Complexity
Complexity: it is difficult to estimate, but we can say it is `O(m + 2^n)` both for time and space, where `m` is length of our `values` and `n` is length of `s`, because we can have example like `(a+b)*(c+d)*...`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def basicCalculatorIV(self, s, evalvars, evalints):
        def AddPol(a, b):
            d = defaultdict(int)
            for x, y in a: d[x] += y
            for x, y in b: d[x] += y
            return list(d.items())

        def MultPol(a, b):
            d = defaultdict(int)
            for x1, y1 in a:
                for x2, y2 in b:
                    d[tuple(sorted(x1+x2))] += y1*y2
            return list(d.items())

        def calculate(s):
            def update(op, v):
                if type(v) != list:
                    v = values.get(v, v)
                    if v.isdigit() or v and v[0] == "-": v = [((), int(v))]
                    elif v.isalpha(): v = [((v,), 1)]
                if op == "+": stack.append(v)
                if op == "-": stack.append(MultPol(v, [((), -1)]))
                if op == "*": stack.append(MultPol(stack.pop(), v))

            it, num, stack, sign = 0, "", [], "+"
            
            while it < len(s):
                if s[it].isalnum():
                    num += s[it]
                elif s[it] in "+-*":
                    update(sign, num)
                    num, sign = "", s[it]
                elif s[it] == "(":                                  
                    num, j = calculate(s[it + 1:])
                    it = it + j
                elif s[it] == ")": 
                    update(sign, num)
                    return reduce(lambda a,b:AddPol(a,b), stack, {}), it + 1
                it += 1

            update(sign, num)
            return reduce(lambda a,b:AddPol(a,b), stack, {})

        values = {x: str(y) for x, y in zip(evalvars, evalints)}
        
        calculated = calculate(s)
        calculated = {x:y for x,y in calculated if y!=0}   
        calculated = sorted(list(calculated.items()), key = lambda x: (-len(x[0]), x[0]) )
        return ["*".join((str(y),) + x) for x, y in calculated]
