#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Edit-Distance-Sequel/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Edit-Distance-Sequel/

#### Solution
First of all, it is not obvious in which way we need to return answer, there is no explanation about it in statement, only in examples! What we actually need to do is to start with the first symbol and return operations we need to do. Let `dp(i, j)` be the answer for subproblem `W1[i:]` and `W2[j:]`. Then we need to recunstruct answer.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, W1, W2):
        l1, l2 = len(W1), len(W2)
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == l1 and j == l2: return 0
            if i > l1 or j > l2: return float("inf")
            if i < l1 and j < l2 and W1[i] == W2[j]: return 1 + dp(i + 1, j + 1)
            return min(dp(i + 1, j), dp(i, j + 1)) + 1
        
        i, j, ans = 0, 0, []
        while i < l1 or j < l2:
            if i < l1 and j < l2 and W1[i] == W2[j]:
                ans += [W1[i]]
                i, j = i + 1, j + 1
            elif i < l1 and dp(i, j) == dp(i + 1, j) + 1:
                ans += ["-" + W1[i]]
                i += 1
            else:
                ans += ["+" + W2[j]]
                j += 1

        return ans
```
