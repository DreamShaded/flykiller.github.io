#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game/

#### Solution
The idea is to check each possibility and return the result.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of state, more exact bound is $O(nk)$, where $k$ is number of possible states. Space complexity is the same.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def generatePossibleNextMoves(self, currentState):
        ans, n = [], len(currentState)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if currentState[i:i+2] == "++":
                ans.append(currentState[:i] + "--" + currentState[i+2:])
        return ans
```
