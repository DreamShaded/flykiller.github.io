title: Leetcode 0142. Linked List Cycle II
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0142/
---

This is very classical problem for two pointers approach: we use slow and fast pointers: slow which moves one step at a time and fast, which moves two times at a time. To find the place where loop started, we need to do it in two iterations: first we wait until fast pointer gains slow pointer and then we move slow pointer to the start and run them with the same speed and wait until they concide.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, because we traverse our linked list twice, space complexity is `O(1)`, because we do not create any additional variables.

```python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            if slow == fast: break
                
        if not fast or not fast.next: return None
        slow = head
        while slow != fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        return slow
```
