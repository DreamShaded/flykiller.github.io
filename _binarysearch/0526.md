#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Longest-Show-Durations/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/K-Longest-Show-Durations/

#### Solution
Use counter here and then use most common.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, shows, durations, k):
        cnt = Counter()
        for d, s in zip(durations, shows):
            cnt[s] += d

        return sum(y for x, y in cnt.most_common(k))
```
