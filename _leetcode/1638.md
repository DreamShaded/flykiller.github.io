#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-that-differ-by-one-character/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-that-differ-by-one-character/

#### Solution 1
There is `O(mn * min(m, n))` solution, where we just start with `i` place in one string, `j` place in another string and go symbol by symbol and continue until we have one difference.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(mn * min(m, n))`. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s, t):
        res, m, n = 0, len(s), len(t)
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                miss, pos = 0, 0
                while i + pos < m and j + pos < n and miss < 2:
                    miss += s[i + pos] != t[j + pos]
                    res += miss == 1
                    pos += 1
        return res
```


#### Solution 2
There is also `O(mn)` solution, using the following idea: imagine, that we have strings of equal size: `abcdefg` and `abxyefz`, then we can find number of substrings with equal indexes of start and end, which are differ by one element in `O(k)`, where `k` is length of this string: for example for given strings answer is `9`: we have `cur = [1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0]` and `pre = [0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3]` (only we do not keep all this arrays at once, but generate them element by element. Then it is necessarily to run our `test(i, j)` for all pairs, where one of the numbers `i` or `j` is equal to `0`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(mn)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s, t):
        n, m = len(s), len(t)

        def test(i, j):
            res = pre = cur = 0
            for k in range(min(n - i, m - j)):
                cur += 1 
                if s[i + k] != t[j + k]:
                    pre, cur = cur, 0
                res += pre
            return res
        return sum(test(i, 0) for i in range(n)) + sum(test(0, j) for j in range(1, m))
```
