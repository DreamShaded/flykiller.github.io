#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/No-New-Friends/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/No-New-Friends/

#### Solution
**It is NOT** about connected components. All we need to do is put all elements from pairs to set and then check that the length of this set is `n`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(m)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, friends):
        d = set()
        for x, y in friends:
            d |= set([x, y])

        return len(d) == n
```
