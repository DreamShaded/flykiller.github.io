#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-stones-until-consecutive/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-stones-until-consecutive/

#### Solution
First of all, value `max - min` will change at least by one on each step, so maximum number of steps is `c - a - 2`, where we sorted values. Also it is always enough to make no more than `2` steps to make them consecutive,If they already consecutive, nubmer of steps is `0`. If some pair is consecutive or have gap `2`, then number of steps is `1`, else it is `2`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(1)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numMovesStones(self, a, b, c):
        a, b, c = sorted([a, b, c])
        mx = c - a - 2
        mn = 0 if c - a == 2 else 1 if b - a <= 2 or c - b <= 2 else 2
        return [mn, mx]
```
