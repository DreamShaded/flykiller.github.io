#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Partition-Lists-to-Make-Sorted-List/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Partition-Lists-to-Make-Sorted-List/

#### Solution
Equal to Leetcode 0768 Max Chunks To Make Sorted II.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, arr):
        left_max = list(accumulate(arr, max))[:-1]
        right_min = list(accumulate(arr[::-1], min))[::-1][1:]
        return sum(i <= j for i,j in zip(left_max, right_min)) + 1
```
