Let us put all the edges into adjacency list twice, one with weight `1` and one with weight `-1` with oppisite direction. Then what we do is just traverse our graph using usual dfs, and when we try to visit some neighbour, we check if this edge is usual or reversed.

**Complexity** is `O(V+E)`, because we traverse our graph only once.

```python
class Solution:
    def dfs(self, start):
        self.visited[start] = 1
        for neib in self.adj[start]:
            if self.visited[neib[0]] == 0:
                if neib[1] == 1:
                    self.count += 1
                self.dfs(neib[0])
    
    def minReorder(self, n, connections):
        self.visited = [0] * n
        self.adj = defaultdict(list) 
        self.count = 0
        for i, j in connections:
            self.adj[i].append([j,1])
            self.adj[j].append([i,-1])

        self.dfs(0)
        return self.count
```
