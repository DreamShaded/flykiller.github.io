#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray-sum-after-one-operation/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray-sum-after-one-operation/

#### Solution
The idea is to use dp with state `dp(i, j)`, where `
1. `dp(i, 1)` is answer to subproblem `nums[:i+1]` where we did not use square yet.
2. `dp(i, 0)` is answer to subproblem `nums[:i+1]`, where we already used square.

Then to evaluate:
1. `dp(i, 1)` we need to look at `dp(i - 1, 1) + nums[i]` and `nums[i]` options, because we can not use square.
2. `dp(i, 0)` we need to look at `3` options: `dp(i-1, 0) + nums[i]`, where we say that we used square before; `dp(i-1, 1) + nums[i]**2`, where we say that we use square right now; `nums[i]**2`, where we take only last number. Note, that there is also option `nums[i]`, but in this case we did not use square at all, so we do not need to take it (moreover `nums[i] <= nums[i]**2`, so in fact we will always gain if we use square)

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)` as well as space complexity.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSumAfterOperation(self, nums):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == -1: return 0
            if j == 1: return max(dp(i - 1, j), 0) + nums[i]  #no square
            if j == 0: return max(dp(i-1, j) + nums[i], dp(i-1, j+1) + nums[i]**2, nums[i]**2)

        return max(dp(i, 0) for i in range(len(nums)))
```
