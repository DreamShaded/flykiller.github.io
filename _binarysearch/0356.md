#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Range-Update/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Range-Update/

#### Solution
Use difference trick, then each operation can be done in `O(1)` and in the end use accumulate.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n + m)`, where `n = len(nums)` and `m = len(o)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, o):
        diff = nums[0:1] + [y - x for x, y in zip(nums, nums[1:])] + [0]
        for l, r, x in o:
            diff[l] += x
            diff[r + 1] -= x

        return list(accumulate(diff))[:-1]
```
