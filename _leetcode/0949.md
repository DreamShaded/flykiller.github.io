In this problem we are asked to check if some possible permutation of digits creates maximum possible valid time. One way to handle this problem is to just check all possible `4! = 24` permutations: this number is quite small and we can afford it. So, we:

1. Create `out = ""`, here we will keep our answer.
2. Check all permutations of `A`, in python there is special function for it, why not use it: for each permutation check if it is valid time: hour need to be `<=23` and minutes need to be `<=59`, which can be written as `P[2] <= 5`.
3. Now, compare new build time with our current maximum and choose best of them. This is all!

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(1)`, but more strictrly it is `O(k!)`, we need to check all permutations in any case, where `k=4` is size of `A`. Space complexity is `O(1)` also, which is more like `O(k)` to keep our answer and compare it with `out`.

```python
class Solution:
    def largestTimeFromDigits(self, A):
        out = ""
        for P in permutations(A):
            if P[0]*10 + P[1] <= 23 and P[2] <= 5:
                out = max(out, str(P[0])+str(P[1]) + ":" + str(P[2])+str(P[3]))
        
        return out
```
