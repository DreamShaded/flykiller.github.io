#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/

#### Solution
Use binary search with adaptation twice: once to find the left place and once to find the right place. I understand that goal is to write binary search from scratch if you are on the interview, but here is solution, using already existing `bisect` library in python. 
The idea is to use `bisect` (which is also `bisect_right`) and `bisect_left` to get the range of numbers: first one will return index before all repetitions of `target` and the second one: after. So, if these two indexes are equal, it means that we did not found this element, so we return `[-1, -1]`. If we found, we return `[l, r - 1]`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(log n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
from bisect import bisect, bisect_left

class Solution:
    def searchRange(self, nums, target):
        l = bisect_left(nums,target)
        r = bisect(nums,target)
        return [-1, -1] if l == r else [l, r - 1]
```
