title: Leetcode 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array
tags: [array, accumulate]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/

#### Solution
In python we can use functionality of language and directly use `accumulate` function, which will give you iterator, which we need to transform to list. And this is all we need to do here. 

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.

#### Code
```
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums):
        return list(accumulate(nums))
```
