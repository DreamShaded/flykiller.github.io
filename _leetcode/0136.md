tags: [bit manipulation, hash table]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/

#### Solution
There is straightforward hash-table solution with `O(n)` memory and time. We can also use bit manipulation trick to evaluate XOR of all numbers, which is what we need.

#### Complexity
Time is `O(n)`, space is `O(1)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        return reduce(xor, nums)
```
