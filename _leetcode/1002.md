#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/

#### Solution
For every word create counter, then intersect all counters.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time, where `n` is total length of all words and `O(max(26, m))` for space, where `m` is the length of answer.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def commonChars(self, A):
        lst = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, list(map(lambda x: Counter(x), A)))
        ans = []
        for x, y in lst.items():
            ans += [x] * y
        return ans
```
