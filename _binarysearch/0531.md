#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/Scrum-Journeyman/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/Scrum-Journeyman/

#### Solution
The idea is to use line sweep with index compression here. Notice, that `types` do not matter at all here.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, I, types):
        P = sorted(set([x for x, _ in I] + [y for _, y in I]))
        d = {x:i for i, x in enumerate(P)}
        m = len(P)
        diff = [0] * (m + 1)
        for i in range(len(I)):
            x, y = d[I[i][0]], d[I[i][1]]
            diff[x] += 1
            diff[y] -= 1

        acc = list(accumulate(diff))
        ans = [[P[i], P[i+1], acc[i]] for i in range(m - 1) if acc[i]]
        return ans
```
