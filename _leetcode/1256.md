title: Leetcode 1256 Encode Number
tags: [math, string]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-number/

#### Solution
Just horrible problem: **you should deduce from the following table**, this is just absolutely lazy way to create problem. Even though I solved it in like 1 minute, it should not be allowed on coding interview. We can guess that what we have is binary representation of `num + 1` with removed first symbol.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `len(num)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def encode(self, num):
        return bin(num + 1)[3:]
```
