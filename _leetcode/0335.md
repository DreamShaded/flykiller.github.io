#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/self-crossing/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/self-crossing/

#### Solution
If we do not have intersections, our data will look in general like two spirals, first: increasing one, and then decreasing. Increasing means `a[i] > a[i-2]`, decreasing means `a[i] < a[i+2]`. There are some special cases we need to process, about 15 lines of code.

There is another smart idea: in fact if we have segment number `i`, it can be intersected only with segments with numbers `i+3, i+4` and `i+5`. So we can iterate over segments and check conditions for intersection. Let `a, b, c, d, e, f` be lengths of 6 adjacent segments. Then we have:

1. `0 < c <= a and d >= b > 0` means that we have intersection of `i` and `i+3`.
2. `b == d != 0 and 0 < c <= a + e` means that we have intersection of `i` and `i+4`.
3. `a + e >= c > 0 and b + f >= d > 0 and b < d and e < c` means that we have intersection of `i` and `i+5`.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(1)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isSelfCrossing(self, x):
        n = len(x)
        x += [0]*6
        for i in range(n):
            a, b, c, d, e, f = x[i:i+6]
            if 0 < c <= a and d >= b > 0: return True
            if b == d != 0 and 0 < c <= a + e: return True
            if a + e >= c > 0 and b + f >= d > 0 and b < d and e < c: return True
        
        return False    
```
