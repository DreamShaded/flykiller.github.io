title: Leetcode 1119 Remove Vowels from a String
tags: [string]
---

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-vowels-from-a-string/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-vowels-from-a-string/

#### Solution
Just iterate through string and check if we need to take symbol or not. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n*5)`, where `n` is the length of `s`, space complexity is `O(n)`. Time can be improved to `O(n)`, if we create set of vowels in advance.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def removeVowels(self, s):
        return "".join(i for i in s if i not in "aeiou")
```
