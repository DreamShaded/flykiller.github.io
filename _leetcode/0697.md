#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/degree-of-an-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/degree-of-an-array/

#### Solution
For each element find its first and last occurrences. Then use counter to count each frequency, find its maximum and then return minimum among all `last[v] - first[v] + 1` for every number with maximum frequency.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findShortestSubArray(self, nums):
        last = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(nums)}
        first = {v: len(nums)-i-1 for i, v in enumerate(nums[::-1])}
        c = Counter(nums)
        degree = max(c.values())
        return min(last[v] - first[v] + 1 for v in c if c[v] == degree)
```
