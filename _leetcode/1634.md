#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-polynomials-represented-as-linked-lists/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-polynomials-represented-as-linked-lists/

#### Solution
The idea is to use two pointers: each for each polynomial and check conditions:
1. if power `p1` is greater than power `p2`, we connect `PolyNode(c1, p1)`.
2. Similar logic if `p2` > `p1`.
3. If they are equal, we connect their sum.

Also, we move pointer in `poly1` if `p1 >= p2`, similar logic for the second one.
Finally, do not forgot to check if `p1 == p2 and c1 + c2 == 0`, in this case we need to continuet traverse.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n + m)`, space complexity is `O(n + m)`

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def addPoly(self, poly1, poly2):
        poly3 = ans = PolyNode(0, float("inf"))
        
        while poly1 or poly2:
            p1 = poly1.power if poly1 else -1
            p2 = poly2.power if poly2 else -1
            c1 = poly1.coefficient if poly1 else 0
            c2 = poly2.coefficient if poly2 else 0

            if p1 >= p2: poly1 = poly1.next
            if p1 <= p2: poly2 = poly2.next
            if p1 == p2 and c1 + c2 == 0: continue
                
            if p1 > p2:
                ans.next = PolyNode(c1, p1)
            elif p1 < p2:
                ans.next = PolyNode(c2, p2)
            else:
                ans.next = PolyNode(c1 + c2, p1)
           
            ans = ans.next
            
        return poly3.next
```
