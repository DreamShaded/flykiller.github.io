#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-tree-partition/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-tree-partition/

#### Solution
Actually what we need to find is there exists subtree of our tree with sum of values equal to sum of all values, divided by `2`. So, let us use function `SumAll(node, v)`, which traverse our tree and also check if sum of current subtree is equal to `v`. On first run we just evaluate sum of all values `S` in tree. In second run we find value `S/2` in our subtree. 

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(h)`. (if we use bfs we have `O(w)` space complexity).

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkEqualTree(self, root):
        def SumAll(node, v):
            if not node: return 0
            curr = SumAll(node.left, v) + node.val + SumAll(node.right, v)
            if curr == v and node != self.root: self.Found = True
            return curr
            
        self.Found = False
        self.root = root
        S = SumAll(root, float("inf"))
        T = SumAll(root, S/2)
        return self.Found
```
