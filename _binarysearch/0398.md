#### Problem statement

<a href="https://binarysearch.com/problems/DDoS-Protection/"> <font color = blue>https://binarysearch.com/problems/DDoS-Protection/

#### Solution
We need to keep queue for all persons as we as individual queue for each pereson. We chech that we keep only last `60` seconds in our queue.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n log n)` for time and `O(n)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, R, u, g):
        R = sorted(R, key = lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))
        gl = deque()
        lc = defaultdict(deque)
        ans = 0
        for idx, time in R:
            while gl and gl[0] + 60 <= time: gl.popleft()
            while lc[idx] and lc[idx][0] + 60 <= time: lc[idx].popleft()
            if len(gl) < g and len(lc[idx]) < u:
                ans += 1
                gl += [time]
                lc[idx] += [time]

        return ans
```
