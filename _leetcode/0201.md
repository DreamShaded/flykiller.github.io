title: Leetcode 0201 Bitwise AND of Numbers Range
tags: [bit manipulation, recursion, math]

#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/

#### Solution
The key observation here is that if binary length of numbers is different, then the answer is equal to zero. If lengths are equal, we remove the first symbol (which is "1") and do recursion. Basically, for two binary numbers `a1...an` and `b1...bn` the answer will be the common prefix and the rest are zeros.

#### Complexity

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, m, n):
        if n == m or m == 0:
            return m
        elif len(bin(m)) != len(bin(n)):
            return 0
        else:
            pref = 1<<(len(bin(m))-3)
            return pref ^ self.rangeBitwiseAnd(m - pref, n - pref)
```
