#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/

#### Solution
The idea is to traverse our tree, starting from the bigger elements, that is first we go to the right, then update `self.total` is sum of all values which are `> root.val`, make `root.val` equal to `self.total` and then traverse the right subtree.

#### Complexity
It is `O(n)` for time and `O(h)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total = 0
    
    def bstToGst(self, root):
        if not root: return
        self.bstToGst(root.right)
        self.total += root.val
        root.val = self.total
        self.bstToGst(root.left)
        return root 
```
