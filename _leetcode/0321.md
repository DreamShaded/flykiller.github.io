#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/create-maximum-number/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/create-maximum-number/

#### Solution 1
Let `N1` and `N2` be lengths of `nums1` and nums2`. First solution we can think about is dp, where `dp[i1][i2][i3]` is maximum number, using first `i1` digits from `nums`, `i2` digits from `nums2` and have `i3` digits so far. To evaluate `dp[i1][i2][3]`, we need to consider `dp[i1-1][i2][i3-1] * 10 + nums1[i1]`, if we take the last digit from `nums1[:i1]` or `dp[i1-1][i2][i3]` of if we do not taeke it. Similar 2 cases for the second number.

#### Complexity
To compare this numbers we need `O(k)` time, so overall complexity is `O(N1 N2 k^2)`, unfortunatelly it will give TLE.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumber(self, nums1, nums2, k):
        nums1 = "".join(str(i) for i in nums1)
        nums2 = "".join(str(i) for i in nums2)
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i1, i2, i3):
            if i1 == -1 and i2 == -1:
                return "" if i3 == 0 else "!"
            cands = []     
            if i1 >= 0: cands += [dp(i1-1, i2, i3-1) + nums1[i1], dp(i1-1, i2, i3)]
            if i2 >= 0: cands += [dp(i1, i2-1, i3-1) + nums2[i2], dp(i1, i2-1, i3)]
            return max([c for c in cands if not c or c[0] != "!"] or ["!"])
        
        t = dp(len(nums1) - 1, len(nums2) - 1, k)
        return [int(i) for i in str(t)]
```


#### Solution 2
There is another, better solution. Let us take `i` digits from first number and `k-i` digits from second number. How we can choose `i` digits, so number will be the biggest? We do it in greedy way, similar to Problem **0402**, using monotonic stack. We iterate over `nums1` and before we put digit to stack, we remove as much digits from stack as possible, so that the beginning of number is increased: `while stack and int(digit) < int(stack[-1]) and attempts > 0`, where `attempts` is how much digits we need to remove at the end. So, we construct maximum numbers for `nums1` and `nums2` in `O(N1 + N2)` for every `i`, and then we need to merge two numbers into one big number. We can do it in `O((N1 + N2)^2)`: compare numbers and choose the first digit of the biggest one, remove this digit from original number and continue. It is not `O(N1 + N2)`, because each time we need to compare full numbers, not only first digits: the question is what to do if we have to equal digits: we need to look into next digit and so on. So, overall complexity is `O(k(N1 + N2)^2)`. I think it is doable in `O(k(N1 + N2))` as well, but it is very difficult.

#### Complexity
It is `O(k(N1 + N2)^2)` for time and `O(N1 + N2)` for space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumber(self, nums1, nums2, k):
        def max_num(nums, T):
            attempts = len(nums) - T
            stack = []
            for num in nums:
                while stack and num > stack[-1] and attempts > 0:
                    stack.pop()
                    attempts -= 1
                stack.append(num)
            return stack[:T]
        
        ans = []
        
        for i in range(k + 1):
            N1 = max_num(nums1, i)
            N2 = max_num(nums2, k-i)
            cand = []
            if len(N1) + len(N2) != k: continue
            
            while N1 or N2:
                if N1 < N2: N1, N2 = N2, N1
                cand.append(N1.pop(0))
            
            ans = max(cand, ans)
            
        return ans
```
