#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iii/

#### Solution
Let us simulate process: at each moment of time we have coordinates `x, y` and direction `dx, dy`. Then we need to take number of steps in each direction `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ...` and do rotation after each sequence of steps. Rotation can be written as `dx, dy = dy, -dx`.

#### Complexity
Time complexity is `O((R+C)^2)`, space complexity is `O(RC)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def spiralMatrixIII(self, R, C, r0, c0):
        x, y, dx, dy = r0, c0, 0, 1
        steps, ans = 2, []
        while len(ans) != R*C:
            for s in range(steps//2):
                if 0 <= x < R and 0 <= y < C: ans.append([x,y])
                x, y = x + dx, y + dy
            dx, dy = dy, -dx
            steps += 1
        
        return ans
```
