title: Leetcode 0404. Sum of Left Leaves
tags: []
---

Very simple problem, where we just need to traverse our tree and find left leaves.

Let us defint `dfs(self, root, side)`, where `root` is current node and `side` is `-1` if this node is left children of some other node and `+1` if this node is right children of some node. Then:

1. If we reached `None` node, then we just return, we are out of tree
2. If current node do not have children, then we check that it is left children of some other node and if it is the case, we add its value to global `self.sum`.
3. Finally, run recursively `dfs` for left children with `-1` and for right children with `1`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, because we traverse every node only once. Space complexity is `O(h)`, where `h` is height of our tree.

```python
class Solution:
    def dfs(self, root, side):
        if not root: return
        
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            if side == -1: self.sum += root.val
        
        self.dfs(root.left, -1)
        self.dfs(root.right, 1)
    
    def sumOfLeftLeaves(self, root):
        self.sum = 0
        self.dfs(root, 0)
        return self.sum
```
